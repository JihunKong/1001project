    "story": "It was a dark silent night in an African village. Suddenly, the only coffee farm in the village caught on fire and the people didn’t know what to do. The farm was burning with raging flames, but a small girl was running around the dangerous fire and screaming her lungs out. “Grandma! Grandma! Where are you? It’s me, Neema! Please answer me!” Neema’s grandmother was born with disabled legs so for all her life she used both her fragile arms to move around. That night, Neema’s grandmother was still not home even though it was past midnight, so Neema went to the farm to search for her grandmother until she saw the huge fire. Neema ran as fast as she could to the burning farm while wishing for her grandma to be safe. However, her grandmother had passed away unable to avoid the spreading fire before Neema even arrived. Neema thought of her grandmother’s words she had told her long ago while eating the corn her grandmother brought from a store in the village before she passed away. Neema’s grandmother said, “Neema, even though your mother and father are not around, do not worry because Grandmother will be with you to protect you. So, study hard and become a great teacher, okay?” After the only person in this whole world who called Neema’s name ever so sweetly passed away, Neema was all of a sudden alone. Neema had to work hard to pay for her school, but it was not even enough money to make a proper meal. Neema tried to ask for help from her teacher because she wasn’t able to pay tuition for that month, but the teacher was also in a difficult situation as well. The teacher said, “ Neema, I’m very sorry, but you can no longer go to school unless you pay the tuition. I want to help you as well, but I have sick parents and I need to pay for their medicine, so I’m not in a good shape, either. I’m so sorry.” Early in the morning, Neema went to Mrs. Mika, the owner of the coffee farm where her grandmother used to work. “Good morning Mrs. Mika, there is something I have to tell you,” Neema said. “Oh, good morning, Neema. Yes, what is the thing you need to tell me?” Mrs. Mika asked. “Ugh… Mrs. Mika, right now I don’t have enough money to pay for my tuition. If you lend me some money, I will come to the farm every day after school and help you with the farm. On the days I don’t have school, I can work all day long. When I graduate, I’ll make sure to pay back everything I borrowed,” Neema said desperately. “I’m very sorry Neema. As you know, because of the pouring rain this year, the coffee trees were not able to produce many beans, and the fire caused great damage to our farm. I didn’t even have enough money to pay our workers, so I had to go down to my relatives myself to borrow money. Right now, the villagers are so poor that they don’t even have enough money to buy food. I think it will be better for you to go to the Tanga village and look for a job than stay here. By the way, you don’t even have any relatives here any way so going to the village will be a good opportunity for you,” Mrs. Mika said with pity. On the way home, Neema was thinking about Mrs. Mika’s words. “Right, The Tanga village is known for its beautiful scenery so there will be many tourists. If I go there, I will definitely make more money to pay my tuition for school. Then I can fulfill my dream of becoming a teacher. I always told Grandma that I would be a great teacher one day so when I become a teacher, Grandma will be very proud of me from heaven,” Neema thought to herself. While holding on to this small hope she had, Neema went to the Tanga village cheerfully. “Everyone! Right here! Follow me this way, we are almost there,” Neema said while guiding the tourists.Neema and the tourists went in the deep dark cave and came out safely. “Everyone, today was a bit tiring, but it was fun, right? We will be going to the coffee farm at ten o’clock. So, please meet at the entrance of the village and please don’t be late. Now, I will take you to the restaurant where they serve the best Tanga meals in the village,” Neema said cheerfully. Neema took the tourists to the restaurant where they sell food. Having been starving the whole day walking, everyone enjoyed eating fresh fish, corn, and octopus at the restaurant. Neema had a smile drawn on her face after finishing her work taking the tourists around the village. “Ahh, today was a bit tiring, but at least I got paid well by many tourists that came out when the beautiful sun shone after the rainstorm. I’m going to go eat some fried rice with coconut sauce at Mr. Azi’s restaurant because I earned a lot of money today,” Neema thought happily to herself. Neema was feeling happy today from earning more money than she usually earned from the tourists that came to the Tanga village. So, Neema went to go eat coconut fried rice at Mr. Azi’s restaurant since she wasn’t able to eat it in a long time. At that time, someone called her.“Child, wait a minute,” a woman called Neema. Neema turned around to see who was calling her. When she turned around, it was one of the tourists from earlier that day.“Oh, hello. Is there any problem?” Neema asked the lady. Neema was worried whether there was a problem with the lady, but the smiling lady answered back cheerfully. “No, dear, no. Your name … was Neema, right? Please correct me if I’m wrong,” the lady said. “Yes, my name is Neema,” Neema answered back politely. “Neema… what a pretty little name. I have a little niece about the same age as you going to school near this village. you were a brave young lady, at the same time I felt sorry that you are working. If it’s alright with you, I would like to talk with you a bit longer while eating dinner together. Besides, I honestly don’t want to eat with people I really don’t know,” the lady said shyly. Neema felt a bit burdened, but she felt happy that someone was caring for her in a special way. “Yes! It sounds great! If we go this way, there is a restaurant that sells my favorite coconut fried rice, but I’m not sure if you’ll like it,” Neema said carefully. Neema and the lady went to the restaurant and talked about many things while eating dinner together. The lady cried when Neema told her story how she had to make money for her tuition after her grandmother passed away from a fire recently and how both of her parents had died from malaria when Neema was not even three years old. While Neema was telling her story, she began to get teary as well, but she immediately wiped her tears and smiled brightly. “Next month, I will be buying five young goats with the money I’ve been saving. I will raise the goats well and sell them in the market at twice the price I bought them. Then I will buy ten young goats again and sell them in the market, buy twenty goats and sell them in the market, and when I sell hundred goats, I will have enough money to go to school without worrying about making more money. If I just think about going back to school, I get so excited that I don’t feel tired at all,” Neema said cheerfully. “Neema… if you want… would you like to go back to the city with me?” the lady asked. “I’m not very rich, but I think I can help you go back to school. After I got married, my husband died from a disease so from then on, I lived by myself. After seeing you, I just thought it would be very nice if I had a pretty daughter like you. What do you think? Do you want to come to the city with me?” the lady asked again. Neema thought of her grandmother after listening to the lady’s kind words and without a second thought, she followed the lady to the city.",

    "story": "Mwema and Afla looked for food in a small village called Miai in Tanzania. Mwema was 3 and Afla was 7 years old. Since their parents passed away, they have been seeking food in village dump sites to live day by day. Mwema asked Afla, “Sis, how do we go to heaven? I miss my mom and dad. Can’t we go see them?” “How many times do you ask me that dumb questions? We can’t go there,” said Afla. Afla became frustrated whenever Mwena nagged about wanting to go see their parents. Mwena started the day nagging. Afla missed her parents so much as well but couldn’t reveal her feelings to Mwena. “Eat this and stay quiet today, please,” said Afla. “No! I don’t want to eat things like this. My stomach hurts! I want to live with my parents just like other kids!” complained Mwena. Afla became so annoyed because of Mwena’s non-stop complaints. “If I didn’t have Mwena, my life would have been much easier…” thought Afla. One day, Mwena and Afla crossed over a valley to get to another town to seek food. Everything looked different. There were more people and bicycles in the town. “Mwena, stay close to me always, OK?” asked Afla to her sister. Mwena did not pay attention to what Afla was saying. “Is that lady prettier than our mom?” asked Mwena to her sister. Afla became angry and told Mwena, “If you mention mom or dad one more time, I am going to leave you alone here!” “My mother must be much prettier than her I think…” said Mwena. Afla yelled to Mwena, “I don’t know. I am not going to take care of you anymore.” Afla left Mwena in the middle of the town and ran to the valley. “Sis! Sis! Where are you going?” shouted Mwena, but Afla didn’t look back and ran away. Mwena tried to catch up with Afla and ran into a bush and she got lost. “Sis, sis! Where are you?” cried out loud Mwena, but she couldn’t find her sister. Suddenly, there was some bustling noise in the bushes. “Afla? Is that you?” asked and ran towards the noise but couldn’t find anyone there. When Mwena looked around, she was surprised to find a little elephant liying on the ground. Mwena got close to the elephant and looked.The little elephant seemed to have been hurt and lost her mother to hunters. “You lost you mom, too? Don’t worry. I will care for you,” said Mwena. Mwena tied banana leaves around a wound in the elephant’s leg. Afla left Mwena in the bushes and walked to a different direction. “Whew… I feel relieved now. She was so annoying. I can leave freely now!” said Afla as she was leaving the town where she left Mwena. However, she kept on looking back and started to worry about her sister. “Will she be OK? She won’t get caught by gangs and sold to bad people, will she?” thought to herself Afla. At that hour, Mwena was hugging the elephant and said, “No worries little baby. I will keep you safe…” As time went by, Afla started to worry about her sister and couldn’t stop worrying. “Geee. I thought I would feel free without Mwena, but Ifeel little guilty. What would my parents think about me? Will they be sad?” thought to herself Afla. Afla couldn’t go forward any more. She turned back and looked for Mwena. It was already getting dark. Although Afla was 7, darkness was scaring her. Afla prayed to her father and mother under the light of early moon. Suddenly, a familiar voice was heard by Afla. “My little baby, eat this. Hope you will be healed soon. Let’s go find your mom and dad. My sis Afla said we must eat well if we want to be well,” said Mwena to the elephant. Mwena then continued to say out loud while looking up the moon in the sky, “Afla, my sis, I am sorry to be a thorn and nagging every second. I won’t complain anymore. I will be your nicest sis.” Hearing Mwena’s voice from a distance, Afla ran into the bush where Mwena and the elephant was liying and shouted, “Mwena! What are you doing here?” “Afla! Here is an elephant. He is hurt! I am taking good care of him. Caring is not easy. I won’t complain any more! I will be your sweat sister!” said Mwena. Afla and Mwena took good care of the elephant. After a few days, the elephant was able to get up and walk. The elephant was able to find fruits in the forest and he was really good at finding fruits! Afla and Mwena followed the elephant around to find many great things in the forest. “Thanks, little elephant!” said Afla. The elephant wiggled his tail and nose. “Thanks, sis for taking care of me and the elephant,” said Mwena. They all wondered around the forest and ate fruits as they were able to find them with the help of the little elephant. They became very close friends. They thanked to one another since they became best friends and care givers.",

    "story": "The siblings, Salma and Frank, lived together with their grandfather. The family were having breakfast around the kitchen table by the window, the bright sunlight was washing over the land, intertwining with the bright blue sky. “Grandpa, today is another beautiful day, isn’t?” asked Salma. “Yes it is, darling,” he replied, creating an upside down crescent moon with his eyes. Salma was the sweet one in the family. She never forgot to thank her grandfather. Salma returned the smile and looked down at her bowl, playing with her wooden spoon with her right hand. “Thank you, grandpa,” Salma said. There was a bit of a shyness in her tone of voice.The sibling’s parents have passed away from a disease a while back. Salma felt sorry for her old grandfather to take care of both of her and her brother. “Oh sweetie, you don’t have to say that,” he said. “Just focus on your study, and I will take care of--.” “Grandpa!” a boy shouted. It was Frank. Frank was the older one from the sibling. Asigh came out of Salma’s parted lips. It was going to be one of her brother’s complaints again. “I need a new pair of shoes. Juma got one yesterday. I can’t go back to class to watch that brat showing off his shoes again. I’m going to throw up,” Frank said with disgust. “Frank, you already have-,” Frank cut Salma off. “Oh, by the way. If I don’t get a new pair of shoes, don’t bother telling me to go to school,” Frank said with a crooked smile. Grandfather equally loved his grandchildren. Even if it meant no dinner for several days, he would make amends to send his grandchildren to school. “Salma and Frank, both of you should go to school now,” the grandfather said. “Make sure to ask the teacher questions if you don’t understand. That’s what I am paying for.” Salma and Frank got up to get ready for school. Salma was already dressed so she was putting on her shoes. She faced her grandfather and smiled. “I will, grandpa,” Salma said. “I will help you with the chores after school, too”. Salma opened the door and left for school. On the other hand, Frank didn’t look happy, and he was still dressing up for school. “Frank!”, grandpa called. “You are going to be late, son. You should hurry. I am going to be sweeping the floor outside so make sure you hurry and get dressed.” The grandfather took his broom and went outside. “Whatever,” Frank said to himself. “Like I care.” Frank was already ten minutes late, and the only thing he cared about was Juma’s new shiny shoes. “There has to be a way…”, Frank said. After thinking about all the different ways to himself a new pair of shoes, he decided to choose the worst one - stealing his grandfather’s cellphone. While his grandfather was still cleaning outside, Frank quickly took his grandfather’s cellphone from his jacket and threw it in his backpack. He then went outside and pretended to go to school. “Are you leaving now?” his grandfather asked. “Yes, I will be back soon,” Frank answered. Frank started running towards the end of the road. “You be careful, Frank! And come home early, I am going to be roasting some corn for dinner!” his grandfather shouted. Frank suddenly felt a little guilty, but he shrugged it off quickly. In the Market Frank sold his grandfather’s cellphone, and with the money, he bought his new shoes. “Yes! Yes!” Frank shouted. He was jumping up and down, and kept looking down at his new shoes. “This is the newest edition. I can’t wait to see Juma’s face tomorrow at school when he sees my new shoes. That brat won’t be able to afford this one. I will be the guy with the best shoes in town now.” Frank was just getting ready to head home until someone grabbed his shoulders from behind and pulled him. “What-,” Frank blurted. Frank turned around to see who it was, and saw a group of boys standing. All of them were at least a head taller than him. “You got some nice shoes there, boy, ” the tallest boy said. “Do you have some money left for me?” The group started laughing and talking to each other. Frank suddenly didn’t feel good, and he knew instinctively that he needed to get away. He looked around if there was a place he can run to but all the paths were blocked and crowded. “Ahh, why are you looking around? I’m not going to bite. Just give me your new goodies and some cash and I will leave you alone,” the tallest boy said. Frank didn’t know what to say. He was already getting scared, but he didn’t want to give up his new shoes. “I..I just got them,” Frank answered. “You think I care?” the boy said in a rhetorical tone. “Now boy, if you don’t take your shoes off in 5 seconds...things won’t look pretty,” he growled. Frank started to shiver. These boys were not the ones he fooled around with in school. “Hurry up, boy! I haven’t had lunch, yet. I am so hungry,” one of the boys shouted from the back. “Oh, time. You just wasted your five seconds. What a pity,” the tallest one said. Frank knew he wasn’t being sorry. He regretted everything. The boys grabbed him and started to hit him. Frank faced pain he never felt before. At the same time, a man was watching the scene unnoticeably from a distance. Salma was on her way home from school, until she saw someone lying on the side of the road. “ugh…” Salma said to herself squinting to see who the person was. She wondered why that person would be lying down in the middle of the road, but she realized that it was an injured boy. Salma quickly ran to the lying boy and shook him to wake him up. “Excuse me. Are you alright? I think you need-” Salma didn’t finish her sentence. She looked at the boy’s face and she knew there was something really familiar about this boy. She checked the boy’s bruised face again to see whether it was who she thought it was. And she gasped.. “Frank?!” Salma called. “Why..Who did this to you? Are you alright?” Salma couldn’t believe what she saw. Her brother’s lips and eyes were swollen. She didn’t check his body, but she knew that his body was probably in a similar condition. Frank opened his eyes, and saw that it was his sister. He never felt so thankful and relieved to see his sister, Salma, in his life. Salma kept asking him what happened. At first, he avoided her questions, but he knew he had no choice but to tell her the truth. “How could you, Frank. How... dare you,” Salma said with disbelief. She couldn’t believe what she just heard. Her brother stole grandfather’s cell phone and bought new shoes with the money. She knew her brother was trouble, but this was way out of hand. “Salma, please. Could you tell grandpa that it was you who stole his cellphone,” Frank pleaded. “I will do-” “Frank, enough,” Salma said with a hard silver tone. “You know that lying is just as bad as stealing. I can’t believe you just asked me to do such thing. If mother and father were still alive, they would have been so disappointed in you. You should be ashamed, and you will definietly get your punishment.” Salma sighed and dropped her head for a minute and faced her brother. “Frank, you need to tell grandpa the truth. Tell him that you are sorry and that you will never steal again,” Salma said. Frank just quietly nodded his head. It was already dark, and the time has been more than two hours since Salma and Frank should have been back home for dinner. The grandfather was getting worried that something has happened to the children. While he was waiting in the dining table, the front door opened and he saw his grandchildren together. But he was shocked by Frank’s beaten up face. “Frank...son, what happened to you. Your face...it is a mess. Are you hurt anywhere else?” the grandfather asked. Frank just nodded his head sideways. “Grandpa, I have something to tell-”. Ring ~ Ring ~ Ring Ring ~ A phone was ringing and Salma and Frank immediately looked at each other. They searched where the sound was coming from and they saw that grandfather’s cell phone was sitting on the table. Next to it, there were even Frank’s new shoes he thought he had lost. From the back wall, a policeman walked toward them. Both Salma and Frank didn’t notice the policeman because they were so focused on their grandfather. Frank started to cry. He was afraid now that he was going to be sent to prison. “Mister, I have done wrong. I stole my grandfather’s cellphone and sold it to the market to buy new shoes. Please, don’t take me away,” Frank begged. “My brother is a good person in the inside. He promised me that he won’t ever steal again. Please, forgive him just this once, and he will never do such a thing again,” Salma pleaded. Frank never felt so scared in his life. The room was silent for a few seconds, but the grandfather broke the silence with a light chuckle. “Frank, Salma, let me introduce your uncle John to you. He was your father’s younger brother” the grandfather said. Frank and Salma didn’t say anything, and both of them looked lost. They didn’t know they had an uncle or rather they don’t remember their uncle since it has been a long time since they seen their uncle. “Hello, Frank. Hello, Salma”, the Uncle greeted. “You two are now all grown up. Look at you, so tall and big. You two were so little when I last saw you. Uncle John was very warm to the children, and he started to tell them stories when they were little. Frank and Salma felt their Uncle’s kindness and quickly opened up to him. “Uncle John…” Frank called with a small voice. “Frank, I remember you telling me that you were going to be a great lawyer and help those around you who are weak and poor. But what you did today, it didn’t seem like something a great lawyer would do”, the uncle said. Frank didn’t have an answer to his uncle’s words. He felt even more guilty by the second, but he still managed to open his mouth. “Yes, I wanted to be a great lawyer. I really did, uncle. But the world around me, it is so full of corruption. There is no good in this world,” Frank said. Frank paused for a moment. He never told anyone what he thought, especially something like this. It was just left aside in his deep mind, forgotten. But after sharing bits of his thoughts to his uncle, he didn’t want to stop. It was like a child licking a lollipop for the first time, but not being able to stop after learning the taste of the sweetness, making it impossible to resist the temptation. His uncle listened quietly and let Frank continue. “Look at Mrs. Marry who lived next door. She was such a kind and generous lady, but she passed away not too long ago. But on the other hand, Mr. Deo is corrupt and full of the wicked mind, yet he still lives very well with a very good life. He even bought a new car not too long ago. The world is so cruel and unfair. Tell me, if it was not. Why did it have to be Mrs. Mary who had to die, not Mr. Deo,” Frank said with louder voice this time. Frank really didn’t understand, and he didn’t want to. Uncle John saw that Frank has finished so he started speaking. “Frank, then let me ask you this,” uncle John asked. “Do you think it’s right for the villagers to steal from each other just like the boys did earlier to you?” Frank couldn’t say anything. His Uncle came up with the perfect words that crushed his beliefs of the world completely. “Here, read this,” uncle John said. It was a newspaper. Frank grabbed the newspaper and started to read the article. There was a big picture of Mr.Deo and his new car. Except that his new car was crushed and broken down. Towards the end of the article, it stated that Mr. Deo died from a car accident while trying to escape a hit-and-run. “We don’t know just by looking at the beginning. The story has not finished yet. If there is a beginning, there is always an ending. Who do you think went to heaven, Frank? Mrs. Mary or the corrupt man, Mr. Deo? Think about it for a moment, son,” uncle John said. The moon was brightly shining, and it was time for uncle John to go. He hugged his nephew and niece, and before he stepped out the door, he smiled at Frank and said, “I believe in you, Frank.” After seeing uncle John leave, the grandfather gathered his grandchildren. “Salma and Frank, remember that God is watching over us. He knows everything, even what you did today Frank,” the grandfather said. Frank lowered his head and didn’t lift it up. “But, it doesn’t mean that you will be going to hell or be sent away. God doesn’t believe that you will do such a thing again tomorrow. God is very generous and loving. He loves you, Frank. If you ask, he will give you countless opportunities to get yourself back up standing tall again. I really wish that you and Salma can see your mother and father again in heaven one day”. Salma held her brother’s hand and said, “Frank, it is okay. I know that we both will see mother and father when we go to heaven.” The grandfather also held Frank’s left hand, and smiled warmly. It also felt as if Uncle John’s presence was Joining the warm and forgiving scene. “Grandpa, I am sorry. I will promise you that I will change and grow up to be a good person,” Frank said. The very next day, Frank woke up early in the morning and herded the goats. Even if no one was watching over him, he helped with the chores and completed his homework. When Frank would see an old woman carrying buckets of water, he would even run and assist the lady. Not too long ago, Frank visited Freddy, who was Mrs. Mary’s son. Frank got new sneakers from his Uncle John, but he decided to give his new shoes to Freddy as a gift. Fredy was surprised to see Frank, but even more so seeing Frank giving him a gift. Freddy was astonished by Frank’s kindness and returned his gratitude with a smile, which he thought he had lost a long time ago. Salma was very proud of her changed brother and she even made jokes about him. Salma tapped her brother on the back and said, “Look at you, Frank. Who would have thought that you will give your new sneakers to Freddy as a gift. Not just any sneakers, but the ones you wanted for so long”. Frank just smiled and looked up at the sky. “Wait, hold on. Could it be that you are my lost twin brother?” Salma jokingly asked. Frank chuckled, and looked at his sister and said, “Stop it, Salma. You are being really silly, you know.” Both Salma and Frank laughed and spent their afternoon watching the beautiful sky. The family still had the same breakfast and did the same chores. Their life didn’t change much but one thing did. It was Frank’s heart.",

    "story": "Once upon a time, there was a shoemaker named Kakama who made colorful shoes for children. Kakama loved children and it filled him with great happiness when children loved his shoes. One day, Kakama was going to the city with twenty brand new beautiful shoes he made. When Kakama was on his way, he ran into a group of robbers. The robbers beat up Kakama and took all that Kakama had with him. Kakama was hurt very badly, but his heart hurt the most. Many children were waiting to wear Kakama’s new shoes. Tadaho, a rich and powerful man, was passing by Kakama and saw him lying on the ground. Tadaho asked Kakama, “Goodness gracious! Are you alright?” Kakama said painfully, “I was robbed and beat up.” “You need to go to the hospital right away!” Tadaho replied. “Can you please take me?” Kakama cried out in pain. “ If I carry you, the fancy suit that I’m wearing will be ruined. I also have an important meeting to go to. Here is ten dollars. Many people pass by this road. Someone else will come to help you.” Tadaho felt bad, but he did not want to be late. “I will take you to the hospital if you are still here when I come back,” said Tadaho as he left for his meeting. Five minutes later, Pakeo walked by and saw Kakama on the ground. Pakeo was well known in the city because he was very smart. Kakama cried to Pakeo, “Please! Help me!” “What happened?” Pakeo asked. “I am bleeding and in pain. Thank goodness you are here, Pakeo. Please take me to the hospital.” “I am not strong enough to carry you, and I have to give a speech,” said Pakeo, “I will go find someone else who can help you, Kakama.” Pakeo left. He wanted to help, but he did not want to wait all day long in the hospital with Kakama and miss his speech. Kakama was very close to dying from losing too much blood. At that moment, Sarama crossed Kakama’s path. Sarama was a poor woman with an only child who was very sick. Sarama was on her way to the city to pick up medicine for her ill daughter. Sarama saw Kakama and ran to him. She asked him, “Are you OK? You are hurt and bleeding!” Kakama looked up Sarama. “Please help me. If you don’t help me now, I will die here.” Sarama took off her scarf and tied Kakama’s leg above his cut to stop the bleeding. “Can you lean on me? I am going to try to lift you and walk with you.” Sarama did all she could to lift Kakama and carry him. Sarama had trouble holding Kakama, but she prayed to God for help. With the help of Sarama, Kakama would get to the hospital safely. Seven days later, Sarama and her daughter visited Kakama to see how he was doing. Kakama was much better and he was waiting to see Sarama and her daughter, Jomopira. Kakama gave Jomopira a gift of colorful shoes. Jomopira was so happy, and Kakama and Sarama’s hearts were full of joy.",

    "story": "Once upon a time, there was a woman named Ruthopara. Ruthopara was a single mother. She had a 9 year old son named Kakama. Ruthopara and her mother, Namori ran an orphanage in a rural village. There were 10 boys and 15 girls in the orphanage. Namori and Ruthopara called the children sons and daughters. Kakama called the orphans brothers and sisters. Kakama loved to play with them all and took care of little brothers and sisters really well. Kakama often made toys for them. He carved woods to make wagons, fishes, or lions. Kakama was very good at crafting. He was able to make just about anything one can imagine. One early morning, Kakama and his little sister who was 2 years younger than Kakama, Taladavana went down the hill to fetch water. Kakama had one big yellow plastic water can and Taladavana had a small can. That day was their turn to fetch water since it was Sunday. The children at the orphanage always took turn to do chores. When Kakama and Taladavana got to the village well, the well was covered with a big wooden cover and two wooden sticks crossing on top of the cover. That meant the water is bad because it hasn’t been raining for a long time and people started to get sick when they drank the water. It was not the first time to see the sign for Kakama because it happened before. Kakama and Taladavana knew where else they need to go to fetch water. There is another well in the next town, but it takes 2 hours to walk there through the jungle and a few hills. Both looked at each other sighed deeply and started to head to the other well. When kids walk in the jungle, they usually sing a song or tell a story so they wouldn’t get too scared. Kakama told his little sister a story about a lion and snake. “Once upon a time there was a lion in the jungle and a snake…” While Kakama and Taladavana were walking in the middle of the jungle, a truck stopped by and a man in a soldier suite got off the truck. “Hey, you two! Where are you going? How old are you?” the strange man asked Kakama and Taladavana. Kakama and Taladavana got scared and didn’t say a thing. “You, get in here.” The soldier grabbed Kakama by his arm and pulled him into the truck. “No. who are you?” Kakama replied. “Just get in,” the man almost threw Kakama in the truck. Taladavana started to cry. The man quickly pulled his handgun and pointed to the forehead of Taladavana and shouted, “Stop crying or I will shoot you.” Taladavana could not cry and Kakama was speechless. “Let’s go, Kabandana. We are late.” The other man in the truck shouted. They took Kakama and Taladavana was left alone in the jungle. The truck was gone and there was nobody in the middle of the jungle. She was so scared, but had to find a way home. She needed courage to walk back alone in the jungle. She heard about lion, snake, or hyena stories before. She prayed that God will help her. On the way back, she ran into a man lying down on the ground bleeding. He was wearing a military uniform as well. She got even more scared than earlier because the soldier had a gun, too. “Hey kid. Do you have some water?” the soldier on the group barely spoke to Taladavana. She stayed far enough so he could not come grab her or harm her. After a few exchanges of words, Taladavana learned that this man had been shot last night by the rebel group that took Kakama away. Taladavana stayed with him to hear more about what was happening and what may happen to Kakama. The man told her that the rebel group will try to make Kakama a soldier and send him to die fighting the country army. Taladavana was so scared and also so sad and started to ask the man how Kakama can come home safely. “I know where they may be keeping him and drugging him to make him their fighter,” said the man. “Please save him. Please,” Taladavana begged the soldier. The man told Taladavana to bring some sticks and something to tie his wound. Taladavana helped him to care for his wound and also found him some cassava roots and figs because he was very hungry. It took one day and one night for him to get better in the jungle and both slowly moved back home.",

    "story": "Ruthopara, Namori and all the kids at the orphanage were shocked and could not believe what happened to Kakama. “Oh my Lord. Please save him. Please help him. Please…Please,” Ruthopara and Namori could not stop mourning. The soldier’s name was, Wakanabone and he was actually a lieutenant in the government army. He lost all of his team in an ambush in the jungle and he was the only one survived to tell a story. “I know where Kakama is and how could I not help him when his sister saved my life?” said Wakanabone. A few days later, Wakanabone came back to Namori, Ruthopara, and Taldavana at the orphanage. “We are going to go to the rebel’s camp in the jungle tonight and we will rescue Kakama,” said Wakanabone. “Please save him and bring him home. Please…,” said Namori. It was dark in the jungle when Wakanabone’s 12 soldiers reached the rebel’s camp. They snuck behind a large oak tree near the rebel’s trench and watched the camp in the dark. In the middle of the camp, there were about 25 rebels drinking around a fireplace and laughing loudly. The rest seemed to be out for hunting for more boys to turn to rebel fighters. Their rifles were set aside, but close enough to grab them if needed. There were a few boys in dirty military uniforms carrying dishes to the rebels. The boys seemed very scared and very weak. There was also a boy tied to a tree close to one of their huts. “That must be Kakama,” quietly whispered Wakanabone to his fellows while pointing his finger to the boy. Kakama seemed unconscious and his head was pointing down and his both hands were tied and raised to a chain hooked to the tree branch. Wakanabone told his men to go about 50 meters west of the camp and quietly pile up wet woods on top of dry woods in about 20 meter long to cover one side of the camp and wait for a signal. When the men took a few hours to pile up the woods quietly, Wakanabone told them to set the wood on fire. When the dried wood caught the fire below, it started to burn very quickly and caused the wet wood on top to smoke a lot. Soon, the camp site was filled with smoke and the rebels were running around like chicken without knowing what was happening. The smoke got into their eyes and they couldn’t see. Wakanabone quickly ran to Kakama and untied him and got him out of the camp. Wakanabone told his men to evacuate quickly to deeper dark jungle where nobody could see nobody. The next day, Wakanabone and Kakama came back to the orphanage safely, but Kakama seemed very ill. Namori and Ruthopara thanked God for Kakama’s safe return to home. Wakanabone told them never to go back to the other town through the jungle to fetch water or walk at night. He said the rebel groups are uneducated, merciless, and horrible terrorists and they are roaming around mountains and jungles to terrorize small villages. “Are you OK?” asked Taladavana to Kakama. “Y…yes… I….a… m…O…K.,” said Kakama very weakly… “Thank, God,” Taladavana said. Everyone at the orphanage thanked Wakanabone and said good bye as he and his men were leaving for their army compound. Namoir and Ruthopara closed the gate tightly and gathered everyone to pray for their safety and also prayed for their country to be peaceful without merciless rebels. Since then nobody goes to the jungle to go to another town to fetch water. It now takes 6 hours to fetch water from another town, but they still thanked God for allowing them to continue to live and enjoy their life at the orphanage. They also prayed that there will be rain soon so they can drink from their own village well. As if God answered their prayers, there was lot of rain everywhere and the village well was filled up with water again. Everyone at the orphanage was so happy that they did not have to walk 6 hours to fetch water. Kakama looked at the sky over the jungle and remembered the time he was kidnapped. It was a scary moment for him and he felt angry as well. He sighed and decided to forgive them. He prayed that those rebels would put down their guns and there will be no more children to be kidnapped. When he opened his eyes and looked at the sky after praying, there was a ray of sun coming more vividly over the village and the jungle as if Kakama’s prayer was answered.",

    "story": "My name is Mariana. I am 12-years old. I live in Paracho, Michoacán. Paracho is the most beautiful place in Mexico. We have a lot of people who make best guitars. My dad makes money by delivering fruits and vegetables from the farm to local stores. My dad is the best in the world for me and my brother Juan. “Dad, go a little faster!” said Juan to dad. Dad drove our old little truck that is the oldest thing in the world. It stops time to time on the road and farts time to time, but when it goes, it can go fast. I said “No, no. Dad, go slow! We don’t want it to stop again! Where do you want to go so fast?” “Guys, we are going to the United States,” said dad. I was so surprised that I could not say anything. Juan was so excited to hear it and asked dad, “Wow! Awesome, dad. Are we going to meet Batman and Spiderman?” “Of course! When we go to the United States, we will never be hungry again! Also, you and your sister can go to school” said dad while smiling. I was worried. Not long ago in our neighborhood, Fernando’s brother was going to cross the U.S. border and he drowned in the river. And, Maria’s family lost all their money to crooks who said they would help them go to the United States. Not only that. Rosa’s dad tried to cross the border through the desert a few years ago, but we never heard from him. Later, we heard that he died in the desert. I couldn’t mention these to my dad now since he would be worried if I did. My dad smiled to us and said gently, “Don’t you worry about a thing! Everything will work out just fine.” Hearing this, Juan prayed, “God, let us go to the United States safely so we can meet Spiderman and Batman. Let us eat a lot of ice cream. If you let me go to school, I will play football really well and win a world cup! Dad made a big smile on his face when he heard Juan’s prayer although he seemed a little nervous. After driving a few days, my dad met some men at night near the border and he gave them the truck and an envelope. I prayed to God, “Our Father in heaven, please let us all enjoy our dinner at a McDonald in the U.S.” It was that night. My dad talked to us while looking at our eyes straight. “Today, we are going to cross the river. You guys just look at my back and follow me, OK?” Juan and I nodded our heads while holding our hands tight. Dad continued, “Well, it’s time. Let’s put our clothes here in this trash bag. This will keep our clothes all dry for us when we cross the river. This is a tube we are going to use. Take this rope and never let it go, OK? And, don’t speak a word or make any noise. You can do this, right?” One of the men who took our dad’s money pointed to his watch and said, “It’s time guys. Now or never.” After hearing this, my dad tightened the rope connected to the tube around his waist and gave us the rope to tighten around our waist as well. He soon immersed in the water and started to swim. We followed him. The water was so cold, but we did not make any noise. We swam with the tube altogether and crossed the river quietly. My dad went through shrubs at the river bank and opened the trash bag to get our clothes. Since our dad told us not to make any noise, we just followed him. Juan also was pretty good in keeping quiet. Dad walked so fast as if he was running away from something. We walked fast to catch up with dad. When I looked up the sky, it was filled with so many stars just like our town in Michoacan. When I looked down again, my dad was about 10 steps ahead of me. I couldn’t call my dad, but tried to walk faster. Suddenly, I heard a man whispering, “Over here!”. When I looked back, a big man from the bushes came out and picked up Juan and me. I yelled, “Dad” in my mind, but couldn’t really open my mouth. Juan and I joined a group of people in a room with very bright florescent lights. There were many children, men, and women. Juan started to cry and said, “I want to go home. Where is our dad? I want to go home.” I calmed down Juan and told him, “Don’t worry, Juan. Dad must be fine. He will come and pick us up soon. Don’t worry…” 6 weeks later, Juan and I came back to Michoacan. We met so many police officers and moved from a truck to another on the way back home. Nobody told us about our dad. However, we believed our dad will come see us soon. Juan and I held our hands together and prayed almost every night. Almost. One evening, Juan asked me, “Dad will come in a Batman’s car with lots of money, right?” “Of course! He will. I will go work at the farm. Iwill take care of you. Don’t worry. I will pick up tomatoes and corn at the farm. Don’t worry.” Two months passed. I worked at the farm and earn 50 pesos a day. I had to fill up 30 big buckets and it took all day. Juan and I boiled pinto beans and made tortillas. We prayed for our dad. Many nights have passed. When Juan and I were eating dinner, Rosa who worked at a street fruit stand burst into our place with a cellular phone. “Mariana! Dad. It’s your dad. Talk to him! Come on! “ said Rosa. “Dad? Daddy? Dad! Dad?” I poured out my heart into the phone. With full of tears, I was holding the phone. Juan ran to me with his mouth still full of Tortillas. “My love Mariana, it’s me. Dad ... how are you? Is everything alright? Is Juan with you as well?” Dad’s voice was coming to me like a miracle. It was really my daddy’s voice. I couldn’t believe it. I felt I was dreaming. I had Juan also listen to dad’s voice. Dad described how he suffered while looking for us, passing through the Death Valley in a mountain, and finally crossing a desert and all. He also mentioned how he was able to get help from in a farm and how he worked there to make money. He tried to contact us, but he couldn’t because we didn’t have a phone. After talking to many people, he finally got in touch with Rosa our neighbor in Paracho. He said sorry to us million times. He said he will send us money through Rosa “Oh God! Thank you, Thank you so much for saving our dad! Thank you so much for getting him a job in the U.S.! prayed Juan with his head on the ground. I didn’t have to work in the farm anymore. I was able to go to school again, too. Dad couldn’t come pick us up right away, but he said he will come and get us. We believe his promise. I now have a cellular phone of my own. Whenever I text my dad, my dad text me back. We pray to God every night. Juan and I are doing fine. Tomorrow, my dad and I are scheduled to talk over the phone. Juan is waiting to brag about his new about joining a children’s football team at his school. I can’t wait to talk to my dad tomorrow. I wonder what kind of exciting things from the U.S. he will tell us tomorrow.",

    "story": "Once upon a time, there was a boy named Amir. He was an orphan living with his old uncle, Wahab. Amir was a troubled kid. He used to spend most of his time in the street bothering people. Sometimes he would hide behind a wall until he heard footsteps. Then he would jump out and scare whoever was there. He was known as a bully, and all the kids were frightened of him. His favorite thing to do at school was make fun of a disabled girl named Huda. Huda was a very kind girl. She lost one of her legs when a bomb exploded near her home and now she had to walk on crutches. Amir always made fun of her and called her a cripple. Some days he would even snatch Huda’s school bag and throw her stuff into the street and laugh at her. Huda hated Amir, but nothing she said would make him stop. She just prayed that God would change Amir and make him a better person. Amir and his uncle lived near a checkpoint guarded by soldiers. None of the children were allowed to play anywhere near the checkpoint. One day Amir talked some friends into playing football a few feet from the checkpoint where their old football field used to be. Amir kicked the ball hard, and it flew passed the soldiers. Amir ran after it, unaware that he was chasing the ball through the checkpoint. The soldiers started shouting and warned all the kids to stay back! But Amir was still running toward the fence. He kept running and shouted at the soldiers: “Hey, toss our ball over!” The soldiers shouted back and warned them to stop or they will shoot. When the soldiers didn’t give the ball back, Amir’s friend Ayub started throwing rocks at them. Suddenly the sound of a rifle shot rang in the air and everyone became silent. Another shot cracked, and all the children started screaming and running away. They were all terrified. Now all the soldiers were firing into the air, and the day was alive with the sound of their rifles. Amir was so frightened and running so fast that he crashed into Ayub. Ayub fell down and asked Amir to help him, but Amir ignored him and ran faster. Suddenly he fell into a deep hole that workers had dug for a new watch tower. Amir was stunned and his legs hurt. He cried for help, but the pain was so bad that he lost consciousness. When Amir woke up he was lying on a hospital bed. He tried to get up but couldn’t move his legs. “Don’t worry, you’ll be okay,” a voice said. Amir looked up and saw Ayub standing in front of him. “You fell down a hole and Amro and I took you to the hospital.” Amir felt really bad and lowered his eyes in shame. Ayub just patted him on the back and said: “We’ll be playing football again in no time. And I will bring you your homework so you don’t fall behind.” Amir could not believe Ayub was being so nice after what he had done to him. Ibrahim, one of the checkpoint soldiers, was worried about Amir. He felt bad for scaring the children and wanted to make sure Amir was alright. He went to the school near the checkpoint and saw a girl walking on crutches. It was Huda. “Excuse me, are you a student here?” The soldier asked. “Yes,” Huda replied, “how can I help you?” “I’m looking for a boy named Amir. He broke his leg near the checkpoint yesterday. Do you know him?” Huda nodded. “I want to pay for his hospital expenses,” the soldier said. “Can you give this money to him?” The soldier put the money in Huda’s hands. Huda started to reply, but a child’s scream cut her off: “There’s a soldier near the school!” Other kids started to throw stones at the soldier. The soldier quickly thanked Huda. “Please don’t tell Amir about me,” he said as he ran away. Huda didn’t know what to do. Amir had been so mean to her and she had always wanted to get him back. She couldn’t forget the way he treated her and the look in his eyes. Then again, she knew Amir’s old uncle was too poor to pay for the hospital expenses. After struggling with the decision for a long time, she finally made up her mind to go to the hospital. She knew deep in her heart it was the right thing to do. After paying the hospital bill, she saw Ayub in the hallway and told him someone paid for Amir’s expenses. Ayub ran happily to Amir’s room to tell him the good news. When Amir heard the story, he was sure Huda was the one who paid the hospital bill. He was deeply ashamed of the way he had treated her. When he went back to school, everyone was staring at him and his crutches. When Amir saw Huda, he struggled with what to say. “I can’t say anything Huda. I don’t know how to apologize to you. After all the bad things I’ve done to you, you paid for my hospital bills. You are an angel!” Huda told him it wasn’t her and that someone else had paid, but Amir didn’t believe her. From that day on, he became a new person. He helped everyone, and was no longer a bully. Amir loved Huda more and more every day. Huda forgave Amir, and they became very good friends. One day Amir, Huda and Ayub were walking by the checkpoint. A soldier waved at them. It was Ibrahim. Amir and Ayub looked at him with hate and anger, but Huda knew the truth. Ibrahim looked at them and smiled. Huda smiled back.",

    "story": "Hi! My name is Kasumba. I have no home or parents. The street is my home. I am probably about 11 years old. People said I look bigger than a 11-years old, but to be honest with you, I don’t know my real age. I am not even sure where I was born. One thing that is for sure is that my home is the street. Today is Sunday. There are many people on the street. People selling merchandises, people begging, and of course people who are trying to steal money from the tourists. You will also see kids looking for food in trash cans. You may not see them all, but there are many kids living on the street. I also search trash bins for food. Today, I have been looking all over, but I couldn’t find any food. I finally sat down next to a trash bin holding my empty stomach. I look around. Isee two people eating sandwiches with coca cola. What a fantastic combination! I always search trash bins for food. You may say Ishouldn’t However, I have only two options: One is to find food to survive or don’t eat to die. Today, I am looking for a different way to survive. Stealing is a very dangerous business. If I get caught, I could die by being beat up. I feel Icould do anything because I am so hungry. I cannot just sit down and wait to die. Since it is Sunday, there are more people on the street. I wondered around. At a restaurant, there are two people sitting around a table and eating lunch on a busy street. I went behind one of the man and pretended to limp for a second and holding his chair. I pickpocketed his wallet. I am not proud of what I am doing, but I may be able to survive another day. What would I buy with money in the wallet? Ibought a cake and one bottle of coca cola. Ihave never eaten a cake in my life. Nobody has bought me a cake for my birthday. The cake came with a few candles. I remember watching a scene of a birthday celebration on TV from a store on the street a happy family singing the happy birthday song for a little girl. I lighted the candles and I blew them out. Idevoured the cake in a second and finished the cola in the middle of a city trash dumpsite. I feel sleepy. The smell from the trash dumpsite doesn’t bother me at all because I am used to it. I don’t like nights because it gets cold. Sometimes, I could not fall asleep. I imagine sleeping in a house where there is a happy family sitting around a fireplace and enjoying dinner together. It would be a house that has a roof and walls, not trash or in the middle of a dumpsite. I know pickpocketing is a bad thing and it is nothing, but a dangerous act. I know there is no hope from doing it to survive. One day, I want to live like others. I want to go to school I pray every day that tomorrow will be better than today. I meet a few brothers. They live on the street, too. “We are going to make some money. Follow us” said the brothers. I know how they make money and I don’t want to follow them. However, if I don’t listen to them, they will beat me up to death. They are waiting at a corner of backstreets and looking for someone. A man approaches with a huge bag of shoes on his shoulder. He looks very innocent and happy. He is singing while coming close to the corner. I pray that the brothers would leave him alone. God does not listen to my prayers. The brothers approach the man and beat him up with sticks. They tell me to watch if anyone is coming near. They beat him up and took every belonging he has. He fall down and bleed. I am shocked by the scene and I flee the scene. I avoid the brothers and do not say anything whenever I see the them. The innocent man appears in my dream. I feel so sorry for him. I pray that someone finds the man and treat him. I pray that God will help him.",

    "story": "I wake up again in the middle of a dumpsite. The stinking smell is a friend of mine. Since Ihave no blanket or pillow, I feel body-ache every morning, but I shake it off with my hunger. Being hungry is harder than anything else. I search my pockets, but I have nothing. I don’t remember when my last meal was. I don’t have much strength to get up. I just lay down feeling the sun shining on me. Perhaps, today is finally my last day. Someone shakes my shoulder. I open my eyes and a foreign tourist appears with a camera. He says things I don’t understand, but he shows me money. I say to myself, “Thank God! You send me a savior!” He showed me pictures I took with him in the middle of my dumpsite. He also gave me a photo. I never had my own photo ever before. He gave me money and left. I put the money in my pocket and look around. “I saw it!” someone said aloud behind me. They are the brothers. I feel so scared, but manage to say, “What? What are you talking about? “ “We saw that white man giving you money and taking photos with you” said the brothers. I start to run, but I have not much strength to run fast. They grab me by my neck and start to beat me up and take the money. When I wake up, Ican’t open my eyes. Someone is wiping my face with wet towel. I try to open my eyes, but they are too swelled up. “Oh! Are you waking up now?” said a stranger. Imanage to peak at the man through my swollen eyes. I am in for big trouble. It’s the man who was beaten up by the brothers 6 months ago. I couldn’t do anything while he was being beaten up. He might feel angry that I was just looking at him being beaten up. I feel scared again to be with the man. I want to run away, but I can’t move.The man examines all my bruises. “I saw you laying down unconscious and bleeding on the street. I brought you here. My name is Kakama. Don’t worry about anything. I will take care of you here” said the man. He cleans my body and put some white cream on my wounds. He also gives me a bowl of porridge. “Can you lean on the wall? Let’s see if you can eat some food. If can you, you will live” said the man. I feel this is not real. This is not right. I cannot possibly pretend that I don’t know anything about what happened to him 6 months ago. The guilt feeling is just so strong and make me shed tears. The man who was beaten up in front of my own eyes is here helping me heal! “Are you OK? Why are you crying?” said the man. I decide to confess to him. I take a deep breath and start to tell him what I can’t hold anymore in my mind. “Uhhhh. I have something to tell you,” I start to pour out my heart. “When you were being beaten up long time ago, Iwas there, too. I was not able to help you or stop them from beating you up. I ran away scared. Don’t be nice to me. I am not worthy to receive your care” “Is that it?” said the man. I nod and say sorry. “I remember that day. I was scared as much as you were. It’s OK. I have no grudge on you” said the man. I stop crying. Peace of mind comes in and fills my heart. The porridge tastes so good and is the best meal I ever had. “Do you live on the street? Do you want to live here with me and work for me?” says the man. With the most joyful color of voice I reply, “Really? Can I really do that? I can work. Tell me anything I need to do!” “Do you have a name?,” asked the man. “My name is Kasumba,” I replied. “Kasumba! What a good name! You can help me with many things,” replied the man. Since it is truly a miracle, I ask him to verify. “Iget to live here and work for you?” asked again Kasumba. “Yes. That will be great if you can,” the man replies. 4 weeks pass by and I am all healed up. I start to help him make shoes. He is really the best man I know of in my life. He is really honest and Iam so happy. I do not need to look for food by searching trash bins or dumpsites. I don’t need to sleep on the dumpsite, either. I still dream the brothers time to time. When Iwake up from nightmares, I pray to God not to dream or see them in my life. One day in Kakama’s workshop, he asks me. “Kasumba, I wish you could forgive people.” “Forgive people?,” I asked. He stops his work and looks at me. “We often do evil things and we get blames. Also, others do the same. If we continue to hold grudge on others, this world becomes a very difficult place to live. However, this world is not as bad as it could be. You know what? That’s because people forgive other” says Kakama. Kakama continues, “Of course it is not easy to forgive others. However, if you do, actually it is you who will benefit the most. You will feel much better and become happier. Don’t hold grudge on the brothers anymore. I see you still waking up from nightmares.” I understand why he tells me all the right things, but it is not easy to forgive those who do evil on me. They beat me to death. How could I forgive them? Kakama continues, “I know It is hard for you. It’s hard for me as well.” Kakama continues to make shoes. I start to ponder. If Kakama did not save me from the street, I would have died. He forgave me and he took me to his place to help me heal. That’s why I am alive today. I start to feel the feeling of relief and happiness. He is right. It’s not easy to forgive someone, but it is actually me who benefits the most. I can be happier if I forgive. I decided to forgive others. I will forgive others as I have been forgiven. It’s hard, but I will start to forgive and care for others for my own sake. At least, that’s what I can start to do today.",

    "story": "The three boys live in a small village in Mwane. The village is named Abushiru and it does not have a post office, a hospital, or even a small store. However, it is a peaceful village where all people live like one large family. Thoughtful Musa, energetic Juma, and smart Amed cannot afford to go to college. Juma cannot tolerate their sadness and says, “Phew, this problem gives me a headache. I really don’t know how to solve it. So, let’s stop worrying and play soccer!” They really like soccer, but they cannot afford a soccer ball. So they collect 100 plastic bags from the village dumpster and use them to make their own ball. “Yay! We did it!” the boys exclaim. After they finish making their soccer ball, they get very excited and forget about their problem. Musa first kicks the ball to Juma. “This is great here we go!” Juma passes the ball to Amed. Then, Amed kicks it to Musa and shouts “Pass! Pass!” They are really excited. Whoops! The ball that Musa kicks flies into an old man’s backyard. “The ball went into the old man’s house. Let’s go there and get it!” Musa says. Juma says, “Sir! Sir! It’s Juma,” and runs to his house.The old man does not answer. When Amed knocks on the door, the door slowly opens. Suddenly, they see the old man lying on the ground. The old man has very poor health. Unfortunately, he has no family who can take care of him, so he lives alone. They are surprised and run to him. Juma looks at him and asks, “Sir, sir, are you okay?” “I am okay. I just fell down by mistake. Don’t be so alarmed.” He kindly smiles and assures the boys that he is fine. However, the old man looks very ill. He coughs a lot and looks pale. The boys help him to his room. Musa starts really worrying about him and whispers to Juma and Amed, “I am sure the old man is really ill. My mother told me he often gets sick these days.” Juma says, “We should help him somehow! We should help.” Amed also agrees to help the old man. “He is kind to children in our village and gives candy to us when we meet. Now it is time for us to help him,” Amed says. The old man holds their hands and says, “I very much appreciate your kindness. However, I really am fine. I have already lived long enough. I am just running out of time in my life. I do not want to bother others.” The three boys are about to cry upon hearing the words of the old man. He does not have any children of his own, but loves all children in the village. Some people say that he has children, but they left once they grew up. Some people say that he has never married and does not have children. No one knows exactly, but that does not matter because everyone knows that he is a very kind and nice person. After the three boys leave his house, they sit and talk seriously about how to help him. “Let’s go search for some medicine! There must be a medicine that can cure him!” The three boys decide to leave in order to find the best medication for the old man. Aday later, they are preparing for their trip. They pack nuts and cassava roots and ponder about how to find his medicine quickly. Wise Amed says, “Let’s scatter and search for medicine. Then, we will be able to find three types of good medicine!” They all agree and leave in different directions. Musa goes to a tribe that makes medicine from snakes. Juma travels to a tribe that makes medicine from roots. Amed goes to a tribe that makes medicine from fruits and flowers. A couple of days later, the three boys return to their village with medicine for the old man. First, Juma gives the old man medicine that was made from roots. He takes the medicine for a week and starts to recover. Next, Amed gives the medicine that was made from fruit and flowers. Lastly, Musa gives the medicine that was made from snakes. They also clean his home, cook, and prepare his medicine for him. Because of the three boys’ care, he stops coughing and recovers his strength. Now he even goes for a stroll in the park. The three boys are very happy to look at the old man’s healthy face. “Hey, aren’t you so happy to see that he is getting better?” asks Juma excitedly. Amed, his face full of happiness, says “Yes, when Igrow up, I want to be a doctor who can take care of sick and weak people. I will help many people! Then I will become a very happy person.” “Sure! Sure! Amed, you are a smart person. I know you can be a doctor.” Juma is excited and chimes in, “I want to be a businessman, so that I can help people who cannot pay for their medical expenses!” However, Musa does not say anything. Juma asks, “Musa, aren’t you happy that he has become healthier?” “Yes, I am extremely happy too! If I can, Iwant to be a school teacher, but we don’t have money to go to college.” Musa cannot say anything more and starts to cry. Amed and Juma also burst into tears. They cannot afford their school fees after they graduate from their school Then, the old man walks to them and says, “Hello, how are you?” “Hello! You look great!” They wipe their tears and smile at him. “I feel great! And it is all because of you boys. I do not cough anymore and can walk very far. Thank you very much for all your help. Could you please go with me somewhere?” asks the old man. Juma answers, “Sure! Please let us know whatever you need! We can do anything you want.” The old man smiles kindly and walks towards the road. The three boys follow after him. They walk for a long time and even have to take a few bus trips. Finally, after the long journey, they arrive at a city and the old man takes them to a college with a dormitory. The three boys are full of wonder as they stand in front of a big, new school building. “Why does he come here?” they ask themselves, “Does he also want to go to school?” The old man says, “You guys promised me you will do whatever I ask you to do. I want to ask you to go to college, study hard, and become a great doctor, teacher and businessman.” The three boys don’t understand what he is asking. Then people from the school rush out to the old man and say, “Welcome, Chairman!” The three boys are shocked. Chairman?! He is the chairman of this big school! They feel like they are dreaming and cannot believe what they are hearing. “Boys, please answer me. Can you please do what I asked you to?” The old man smiles and requests once more. Juma answers first. “Yes, Sir! ” Amed and Musa also answer loudly, “Thank you very much, sir! We will study very hard and become good people who you will be proud of!” Since that day, the three boys studied hard to become a great doctor, teacher, and businessman. The entire village was very proud of them.",

    "story": "”Neema! Neema! Where in the world is she!” The lady’s sharp voice rang all over in the house. Neema immediately went inside the house from cleaning the backyard when she heard the lady’s angry voice. “Lady, what is the matter?” asked Neema. “Neema! What were you doing until now when I told you to iron the dress I will be wearing today?” said the lady. “Lady, I ironed your dress last night and hung it in your closet. Please check again.” Then the lady yelled at Neema again who cleaned the house till midnight and cleaned again early in the morning. “There are guests coming over today so hurry up and finish cleaning. When you are finished, go to the market and buy some groceries. Cook some lamb stew, Chipsi, and Ugali. Don’t forget to have the coconut juice chilled. I will be going out again to run some errands. Hurry and finish everything before I come back.” The lady quickly got dressed and left. Neema had lived with the lady for 6 months already, but she still didn’t attend school. She did chores every day and cooked for the lady with a thought that the lady would send her to school very soon. Neema, wanting to go to school even a day faster, couldn’t bring out the subject of school because the lady would have a scary face on and got angry whenever Neema talked about school. “The lady must have a problem right now. She promised me that she would send me to school and must have been very busy lately. I must tell the lady tonight after the guests leave.” Neema thought to herself while cooking dinner for the guests. After the guests had their dinner and left, Neema went to the lady’s room. “Lady, it’s me, Neema, I have something I must tell you,” Neema said knocking on the door. The lady opened the door with sleepy eyes. “What is it, dear?” the lady said with a sleepy voice. “Lady, I would like to discuss the school with you. Iwaited every day for you to bring out the subject first, but it seemed you were very busy these days. Next week will be the deadline for school registration, so I was wondering if can go register for school,” Neema asked the lady cautiously, but the lady seemed very angry again. “School? Did you just say school? If I brought you here to live comfortably, you should know how to be satisfied, but you even thought of going to school? Who will do all the chores and the cooking when you go to school? If Ifed you and provided a place for you to sleep, you should be thankful instead of complaining!” the lady yelled at Neema and picked up a cane that was next to her. “A children like you who have no clue how to be thankful should get hit until they realize!” The lady started hitting Neema everywhere with the wooden cane and Neema then realized the true heart of the lady. That night when everyone was sleeping, Neema got up from her bed and started to pack her belongings even though her body was bruised everywhere. Neema packed a bit of her clothes and some money she has been saving. She then started to walk through the hallway to the door quietly. “creeeeek….” The lady woke up by the sound of the metal door and Neema quickly started to run with her swollen legs without looking back. “Neema! Neema! Come back, right now! If I get you, I will make sure you starve for days in a locked cellar!” the lady screamed at Neema. The lady tried to catch Neema, but it was after Neema had run away. Neema heard the lady’s voice calling her, but she kept on running without stopping. “I must go back. I’m going to go back where Grandma and I used to live. I don’t care if I don’t go to school anymore. I want to go back to my village where my friends, friendly villagers, and teachers are.” Neema wiped her tears that were running down her cheeks and kept running. Many things have changed in the village. Mrs. Mika’s coffee farm has grown and also started to receive tourists who like to learn about the special coffee beans grown in the farm. Many tourists enjoyed their trip and returned with their friends and families. Many people in the village made more money and even built more cottages for tourists to stay while enjoying fresh seafood in the nearby beach. The whole village has become a bustling tourist town. With increased income, parents were able to send their kids to school. After Neema’s return, Mrs. Mika visited Neema. “Neema, how have you been? We have been thinking about you ever since you left to go make money in the Tanga village,“ said Mrs. Mika. Neema explained all the details about her long hard journey. After hearing Neema’s story, Mrs. Mika felt sad and pity for Neema. “Neema, we learned that other villages invited tourists to their coffee farm and made money from ecotourism. We followed their suit and we made money, too. We paid most of our debts and made good money by selling cultural artifacts to the tourists as well. Since you are back safe and sound, we would like to help you in any way possible,” said Mrs. Mika. Mrs. Mika suggested that Neema should be a part-time tour guide as she did in Tanga village and go to school. Our villagers made enough money for all so we should village. Since you are smart, you will catch up quickly! “What? Neema is back?” someone shouted outside. When Neema turned around to see who shouted, there were villagers with big smiles on their faces welcoming Neema. There were Neema’s former classmates as well. Everyone in the village were happy to see Neema back and Neema also felt relieved to be back and welcomed by the villagers. Neema studied really hard in school. She even helped Mrs. Mika’s farm whenever she had time. With Neema’s bright smiles on her face, everyone was truly happy to have her back. . . “Grandma, mom, and dad. I am so happy to be back. Your old neighbors are so nice to me and helping me a lot now. I am studying hard and helping Mrs. Mika in her farms and her little kids with their homework. I am so happy to be helpful. I like to be a teacher one day and help many orphans. Please watch over me…” prayed Neema.",

    "story": "James, a 12-year old boy, lived with his mom. James’s mother worked hard every day to raise James. She smiled and whispered to James, “My love, James. I am sorry for not being able to buy you a new pair of shoes or cook some delicious meals. However, I know you will still grow up strong and become a great person for this world. Let’s live righteously as your dad in Heaven is happily watching over us.” Being poor could not stop them from being happy. James knew it all and thanked his mom always. James wanted to become a great person and wanted to make his mom and his dad in Heaven proud. One day, after working hard for several days, James’s mom became seriously ill. With the help of her neighbor, she was brought to a free clinic run by a foreign aid organization nearby town. James’s mother looked pale. James prayed and asked his dad in Heaven to help. “ Dad, please save my mom. I will be a better boy. Please help her, dad,” prayed James. The doctor at the hospital said, “Your mom may go home now. However, do not forget to have her take this medication every day. This medicine is free, but it is very strong medicine. She must be well fed before taking the medicine.” “Thank you, doctor. I will be sure to have her eat plenty of food and take the medicine,” said James with a great smile on his face. James was happy that his mom would be fine and could go home although she still looked ill. As soon as James came back home, he looked for food to give to his mom. He knew that she must be well fed before taking the medicine. He couldn’t find anything to cook. Their kitchen was completely empty. James’s mom took the medicine, however, because it was time to take the medicine. James’s mom vomited and suffered greatly since her stomach was empty. James became so sad. Since James’s mom could not go out and work, there was no money for them to buy food. James went back to the hospital to ask the doctor what to do. The doctor said that the medicine was free, but they did not have food to give On the way home, James looked up at the sky and his dad in Heaven. James felt so lonely and he was afraid that he might be left alone without his mom if he could not help find food for her. “ My bag! Please help!” an old man shouted in the village. James looked back and saw an old man screaming and a boy running away with a bag. James knew that boy. He was the most naughty boy in the village. He must have snatched the old man’s bag. Without much thinking, James ran to the boy so he could get the bag for the old man. The naughty boy ran and ran and arrived at the village dumpsite. The boy shook the bag upside down and things fell out of the bag. The naughty boy quickly searched for valuable things, and he ran away with a flash light. James finally caught up and got to the dumpsite as well. When James saw the bag and the old man’s belongings, he picked them up and put them all back in the bag. From one of the old man’s jackets, a watch fell out. As soon as James saw the watch, his heart was shaken. Suddenly, he imagined his mom eating deliciously made Ugali. If his mom could eat, she could take the medicine. “What can I do, dad?” asked James while looking up the sky. There was nobody at the dumpsite, only garbage flies hovering over smelly compost piles and trash. James burst into tears while holding the old man’s precious watch in his hands. He wasn’t sure why he was crying. After shedding tears after tears, he put the watch in his pocket. He put the rest of the belongings in the old man’s bag and set the bag on top of the trash pile so the old man could find it easily if he came to the dumpsite. James sold the watch and bought three big bags of corn flour. James told himself, “I am a thief. What would my dad think of me now? Dad, please forgive me. I just want save my mom,” said James. James came back home and with a happy face told his mom, “Mom! I will make Ugali now. So you can take the medicine.” As soon as James turned to his mom, he was shocked and couldn’t move his body an inch. There was the old man in his house. He was helping his mom get up. His bag was also in front of the door. “What is happening? Did he find out that I stole his watch? Is he here to send me to the jail? What will happen to my mom then?” wondered James. James’s mom smiled to James and said to the old man, “Dad, that’s my James. He has grown up so big. James, come here my boy. This is your grandfather,” said James’s mom. “Hello James! You probably don’t remember me because when I first met you, you were still 5 years old. We met this afternoon, too!” said the old man. “Ye... Yes…Grandpa.” James barely made his voice. James’s grandfather looked at the corn flour bags James was holding in his chest and smiled at him. In the night, James’s grandfather called James to come outside and talked to him softly. “James, there is one thing you shouldn’t do. Do you know what that is?” said Grandfather. James said with his trembling voice, “Yes……” “Then, it is fine. If you know it, that’s fine,” said Grandfather. Suddenly, James broke into tears and said, “I am sorry, Grandpa.” “Okay, James. Now I am here. Your mom will get better as long as she eats well and takes the medicine,” said Grandfather. Looking at the big smiling moon, James prayed. “Dad, I want to grow up to be a great man like you. Please look after us,” said James. That night, James and his grandfather sat under a tree and smiled back to the moon.",

    "story": "In the small village of Chandra Babu Nagar, there lived a very happy family of four: a young boy named Rajesh, his mother, his brother and his father. Rajesh’s mother was a lovely lady. Despite the fact she had no education as a child, she worked hard to pay for her own education and get a decent job in the village. Rajesh’s father also worked in the village, as a street cleaner. Rajesh’s father worked very hard to He would sacrifice anything for the family’s happiness because to him, nothing was more important than family. Although he would come home stressed from the workload every day, he was still happy. He was always very tired but remained calm and found time to spend with his wife and two sons. He was a loving father, but he was very strict and he disciplined his two sons harshly, who learned from him to become better people with stronger character. One day after work when Rajesh’s father was sleeping, Rajesh’ mother was cleaning the clothes and found a pain killer tablet in Rajesh’s father’s jacket pocket. She started to panic and cried to Rajesh, who tried to calm her down. Together, they asked father why he was using the medication. Father told them that he had been hiding his chronic stomach pain from them. Mother forced father to go and see the doctor at the city clinic and sent Rajesh with him. Father and Rajesh left the house the next morning and began their journey to the city clinic by bicycle. The journey took 3 days. On the way, Rajesh told his father stories to help him forget about the pain. One story that Rajesh had heard in school was about a brave African boy named Kakama, who saved his entire village. Rajesh tried to give hope to his father even though he was scared himself. When they arrived at the clinic, the Doctor did a free checkup and reviewed the results. He then told Rajesh’s father that he was suffering from stage 4 stomach cancer, which had already spread to his other organs, and that the only way to cure him would be a surgical operation. “Unfortunately”, he said, “the surgery is very expensive”. Rajesh started to cry and couldn’t stop his tears. “Although”, the Doctor said, “Once a month, we offer one free surgery to the person who writes a petition convincing enough to inspire the director to sponsor the surgery.” The doctor continued, “The chances of winning are very low, winning needs a high literacy skill.” Rajesh’s father was illiterate, so he didn’t think he had a chance in the competition. They rode back to their village in silence, but Rajesh still had hope in his heart. When they got home, Rajesh told his brother about the competition and, together, they promised their parents that they would win. Father’s health condition soon got worse and he was fired from his job. Rajesh’s mother started to work more hours cleaning people’s houses and the boys dropped out of school to find jobs: Rajesh in a Mechanic shop and his brother in a restaurant. They all tried to earn enough to pay for the surgery, but they were nowhere close. Rajesh and his brother, with help from their ex-schoolteacher, worked on the petition day and night, writing 33 drafts in all. Finally, they submitted it to the clinic, but it was rejected. Father didn’t want to be the reason for his children leaving school and his wife becoming a maid. He blamed himself and felt useless. He couldn’t stand the pain any longer and made up his mind to hang himself in order to rescue his family from this situation. He wrote this note to his family: Rajesh started to cry and couldn’t stop his tears. Dear Family, Thank you all for everything. My sons, Rajesh and Suresh, take care, go back to school and study hard to get into college and make a better life for your mom. My lovely wife, Sakshi: stay strong and do not feel left alone because you know that I will always be with you and with our sons. I cannot live in this pain any longer; I cannot see you suffering because of my health condition. I’m ending my life and I leave you to God. Love, Anand The next morning, after everyone had left home to go to work, father placed the note beside him and put the rope around his neck. Just outside, Rajesh was returning home early to pick up his tools, which he had forgotten to take to work. Rajesh opened the door and saw his father hanging and choking. He jumped up and cut the rope with his knife, allowing his father’s body to fall to the floor. Rajesh shook his father’s shoulders hysterically and called out his name. He prayed to God to save his father, whose eyes then slowly opened. Rajesh told him: “Dad, you always taught us to be hopeful and trust God. Why are you doing this? We will write the petition 100 times again until we win the competition and get you that surgery.” Father felt very regretful and asked for forgiveness from Rajesh. They decided not to tell mother or brother what happened. Rajesh worked harder and harder on the petition, praying to God for help and reading from books every night to improve his writing skills. After three months of this with no success, he considered selling his liver just to get some money for his family. In one last attempt, Rajesh put all his heart into his writing. He wrote about his father’s plan to commit suicide and about his own plan to sell his liver. The director of the clinic, so inspired by Rajesh’s brave, hardworking and self- sacrificing personality, declared his story the winner and agreed to perform the free surgery for them. After the operation Rajesh promised himself that when his dad got better and he returned to school again, he would study really hard to become a doctor to save other poor people. Father opened his eyes and looked at his brave son. He had a beautiful smile on his face and saw the spark of hope in Rajesh’s eyes and Rajesh smiled back at his father.",

    "story": "Our fathers have a saying: “where there is determination there is a way.” This is a story about two young girls, Farida and Rehema who were determined to find their way, no matter how hard their lives were. Farida and Rehema are orphans. Rehema is not well-behaved, while Farida is the complete opposite. One day they went to school and the teacher asked them, “Why do you guys come to school only once or twice a week? Who takes care of you at home?” Rehema replied, “What will you do about it after I tell you?” Farida warned her sister that was not the right way to talk to others. Farida explained to the teacher that they used to live on the street until their Grandma adopted them. They live a hard life because Grandma doesn’t take good care of them and makes them cook, do all the chores, and clean the house. Grandma made money by cleaning other people’s houses in the town, but now she makes Rehema and Farida clean the houses. They don’t have time to study when they return home. They are always hungry because Grandma doesn’t give them much to eat. “Both our mom and our dad died,” Farida said to the teacher. “I am really sorry, Farida,” the teacher said. “No problem.”, she replied. Rehema was not very happy with her sister for telling the teacher about what was going on in their family. “Do you think she is going to help you?” she yelled at Farida “She is just curious. That’s all. Is that bad? What else can be worse?” Farida asked. “But do you honestly think she will help you?” Rehema replied, her face wrinkled with anger. Rehema was almost 14 and seemed to be angry about everything around her. Farida sat down for a moment and thought about her life and that of her little sister, Rehema. “But do you honestly think she will help you?” Rehema replied, her face wrinkled with anger. Rehema was almost 14 and seemed to be angry about everything around her. Farida sat down for a moment and thought about her life and that of her little sister, Rehema. Right after they finished cooking, Grandma’s daughter Mwanahamisi, whom they called auntie, came to visit. When auntie came and saw the lunch Rehema and Farida made, she ate their lunch and then told them to go clean her house as well. Auntie’s house was so filthy that it was midnight before they finished cleaning. They were so hungry and so tired that they fell asleep at auntie’s house. The next day, Farida and Rehema sent out on their way back to their Grandma’s. When auntie found out they had left, she felt relieved, because she did not want to give them any food at her house. On the way back to Grandma’s house, Rehema and Farida met a young man named Issa. He seemed to be lost and looking for directions. “Jambo! Ladies. Which way to Newalla town?” Issa asked. “Oh. We just came from there. We came from our auntie’s and we are going to our Grandma’s. Newalla is that way,” said Farida pointing toward the town. “Asante sana. Excuse me, but you girls look very tired already. It’s only 10AM,” Issa said to them. “We worked all night last night and haven’t eaten a thing since the dinner the day before yesterday.” Farida replied. “Oh no! Come here and I will give you some food. I have some left- overs from my breakfast I picked up on the way to this village,” Issa told them and got a bag from his car. “Wow! Asante sana, but we don’t want to trouble you, sir” Farida replied. “But we will take it if it is not too much trouble,” Rehema replied. With a smile on his face, Issa gave them some food. Rehema and Farida were so hungry they devoured the left-over food in a matter of seconds. “How many schools are there in this area?” Issa asked them. “Here? There is only one small primary school which we attend,” Farida replied. Issa asked them all to sit down, because he wanted to talk to them. They found out that Issa is from Dar es Salaam, and he was visiting the region because he was going to become the director of a new woodcraft manufacturing factory. After hearing the life stories of Rehema and Farida, Issa suggested that they live with him starting next month. Issa was also an orphan and he studied hard to change his life. Issa knew that education is the only thing that can change one’s life. Because of all his personal experiences as an orphan, Issa saw Rehema and Farida as his sisters, because he knew how hard it is to live as orphans and live with other families, and do other people’s chores for them. “I would like you to become part of my family” he said. The girls were thrilled to hear it, and happily followed Issa to his new home in Newalla. When they arrived, Issa told them to make themselves at home. As they looked around the house, they saw things they had not seen before things like electricity, a television, and a computer with internet access. Issa was a very young man, but became quickly successful by studying hard and getting a college education. He received his bachelor’s degree in business administration from a university in Dar es Salaam and also a full scholarship to a university overseas where he earned a master’s degree in business administration. Is sa was single, so he enjoyed having sisters around so they could live as a family. Issa had a maid and a cook, so Rehema and Farida didn’t have to cook or do any chores. The girls were happy to have time to study. They attended school every day and worked really hard. They read as many books as they could find and learned to speak English as well. Thanks to Issa’s kindness, the girls grew up and went to college. They studied even harder in college and received scholarships which waived their tuition and fees for books. After graduating college, they got jobs; Farida worked at the Bank of Tanzania and Rehema became the head of a secondary school. They lived happy lives and became great role models for all the orphans in the rion.",

    "story": "Kiokote lived with his family in Mangaka village near River Ruvuma, where he liked to fish. He had a small boat and a very good fishing net. He also had more than goats and plenty of food. There was no one in the village that was better at fishing than he was. Also, nobody made goatskin leather clothes and accessories better than him. Because he always wore a goatskin jacket he proudly made, he was also known as a goat jacket man. However, no one in Mangaka village liked Kiokote, because he was very selfish. One day Likoti, who was another fisherman in the village, went to Kiokote’s home for help. Likoti was sick and could not fish, so he and his family didn’t have any food. “How is your afternoon, Kiokote?” Likoti asked. “Good Likoti, and you?” he responded. “I have not been doing very well. I have been ill and my family doesn’t have any food because Ihaven’t been to the river for the past three days.” “So how do you want me to help you?” Kiokote asked. “I could use two small fish, some goat milk, and some money for my medication,” said Likoti. “I cannot give you any of my food or money because your illness and your problems do not concern me,” said Kiokote. Likoti headed back to his home, saddened by his failure to get the help he needed. The next day at dawn, Kiokote took his fishing net and his boat and headed to the river for another fishing day. When he got to the river bank, there was a boy named Elimu sitting there, looking out at the river. Elimu’s father was Darweshi, and they lived very close to where Kiokote lived. As soon as Elimu saw Kiokote coming, Elimu asked him, “Are you going out to fish? If so, could you look for my father? He hasn’t come home for two days.” Hearing this, Kiokote replied, “Really? I will see if I can find your dad. Can you go to my home and feed my goats some weeds? Be sure to feed the little ones first.” “Yes sir. I will be sure to do it, but please, please find my dad and come home with him,” replied Elimu with wet eyes and a sob in his voice. When Kiokote got in his boat and went downstream, he was surprised to find other fishermen fishing there. They seemed to be doing quite well. He then rowed to the deeper part of the river. He lowered his net into the deep water and trapped some fish, but they were too small so Kiokote threw them back. He lowered his net at another spot where he thought large fish were swimming and soon there were plenty of fish trapped in the net. When the other fishermen saw that he had caught a lot of fish, they offered to help, but as expected Kiokote didn’t think he needed anyone’s help. He could do it all by himself, and he certainly didn’t want to share any of the big fish he was catching. After the other fishermen had gone, Kiokote was left all alone to try to pull up the net. The net was very heavy, but he kept pulling on it with all his might. Still, he wasn’t strong enough to pull the net up. Instead, the big fish were pulling the net further into the water. Kiokote fought hard with the fish in his net, but suddenly, his boat capsized and he was pulled into the water. While all this was happening, Elimu went to Kiokote’s home to feed weeds to his goats. When he arrived at Kiokote’s home, he heard screaming from the house. Elimu rushed into Kiokote’s house and found Kiokote’s wife Fatuma lying on the ground in agony. Elimu asked Fatuma, “What’s wrong? What happened?” “Go find Gaudiosa. Tell her to come to me now. Something is wrong. My baby is not due to come out this month. It’s too early. Go get Gaudiosa!” Fatuma screamed. Elimu ran out to look for Gaudiosa, an elderly lady who serves as a midwife in the village. Elimu ran to Gaudiosa’s house, but she was not there. Elimu ran around the whole village, but he couldn’t find Gaudiosa. After searching for her for 20 minutes door to door, he decided to run to a clinic in the town nearby. It’s about 20 minutes by motorcycle, but Elimu thought that he had no other choice. He had to go find a doctor in the town. Elimu ran like a rabbit on a muddy, narrow road. He jumped over little ponds along the way. He sweated, and his clothes were all muddy, but he ran and ran as fast as he could. By the time he got close to the town, he realized that his right was foot bleeding. A broken bottle piece had pierced his bare foot, but that didn’t stop him. He kept running to the clinic. When Elimu got to the clinic, he almost fell down from the pain. “Oh my gosh, are you alright? What happened?” a nurse at the clinic asked Elimu. The nurse was looking at Elimu’s bleeding food. A doctor who was diagnosing a patient inside a partitioned area looked out and saw Elimu catching his breath. “Was there an accident, boy?” doctor asked. “What happened to your leg?” “No, no. I am fine, doctor, but please come with me quickly. A mother in Mangaka village is about to give birth and she is all alone and she is in trouble. Please come!” “We need to take a look at your leg first. You are bleeding. You will be in big trouble if we don’t stop your bleeding,” the doctor said while he examined Elimu’s foot. Meanwhile, Kiokote was in the river struggling to get on top of his capsized boat. He lost almost all of his strength from fighting with his net, which was now lost along with all the big fish. He now had to struggle to keep from drowning. It was so difficult for Kiokote to get on top of the boat because the surface of the boat was so slippery and he kept on falling back into the water. I am the wealthiest person in the whole village, but now I have nothing to show for it and I am losing my life as well. My wife is about to give birth next month and I even have 10 goats. Why have I been so selfish in my life? Why haven’t Ishared with the needy? Why didn’t I share fish with my friends? Oh no… I am so silly…” Kiokote thought as he was losing his last bit of strength to get on the capsized boat. “ Hey! What happened? Do you need help over there?” a man shouted to Kiokote from a distance. It was Elimu’s father Darweshi. He discovered Kiokote as he was returning home from fishing a long way downstream. Kiokote couldn’t even say a word because he was so thankful to see Darweshi approaching him to help. He shed tears from his eyes and thanked God for sending a lifesaver. He decided to be a good man from that moment on. Darweshi pulled Kiokote out of the water and returned home with a lot of fish he had caught from downstream. “Oh you guys are home! You have no idea about what happened while you guys were gone!” said Zulfa, the nurse from the clinic. This little boy ran all the way to the clinic to help for this lady to deliver her premature boy. Luckily, God was with us this afternoon. She delivered the boy successfully. Elimu limped and hugged his dad who was helping Kiokote sit down on a chair in front of the house. “What happened to your leg, my son?” Darweshi asked Elimu. “Oh that. You wouldn’t believe what he did today. He is a hero today!” said Zulfa. Zulfa explained to Kiokote and Darweshi how Elimu injuered his foot running to the clinic. “He refused to get his leg treated until we came to the village to help Kiokote’s wife.” When Kiokote heard all this, he shed more tears and hugged Elimu. “You are my son. You saved my wife and my son. Thank you, Elimu. Your dad saved me today, Thank you Darweshi. Thank you everyone. Thank you, God,” said Kiokote still shedding tears Kiokote told everyone, “Self-centeredness is really foolishness. I was self-centeredness at times when I should have worked with others”. Next day, Kiokote took two goats in his hands and gave them to Derweshi. “Thank you very much for your help, my friend,” Kiokote said. Kiokote also went to Likoti’s house to give him a big wheel of goat cheese he made and also two fresh buckets of goat milk and said, “I promise to change my selfish ways and start working with you as a team in everything.” His friends forgave him and they went on being good friends, helping each other through good times and hard times. Everyone shared and everyone helped each other. The whole village was full of sharing and helping minds and abundant happiness.",

    "story": "Ashura is a kind and cute girl who lives in a small town called Majengo. She lives with her dad, who sells vegetables from his stand, and her mom, who cooks the most delicious Ugali (African rice cake made from maize). Ashura’s dad returns from his job each day looking tired. Even though he works hard, he worries about feeding the family and buying Ashura’s school supplies. Ashura feels sorry for her dad having to work so hard for the family, and she thanks him for his effort. She speaks to her dad after he comes back late one night from work. “Dad! My teacher says no matter how difficult a situation is, if we try hard without losing hope and remain honest, everything will turn out fine. So cheer up, Dad!” Her dad smiles faintly. Her mom nods with approval. However, things in Ashura’s home are getting worse. There are days when they have nothing to eat. Then one day, her dad decides to go far away to sell pineapples and cabbages. Ashura worries about her dad biking a long way, all alone, with a large basket of fruits and vegetables. “Goodbye, Dad. Good things will happen to us soon. Cheer up Papa. Cheer up!” “Okay, you must mind what your mother says.” He hugs Ashura and her mother and sets off on the long journey A few days pass, and Ashura does not hear anything from her dad. Ashura and her mother start worrying about him. Then one day, the village headman runs quickly to Ashura’s home. “Bad news!” he cries, “Your father had a terrible accident on the way back home!” Ashura’s mother sees everything go dark. “A speeding car hit your father and he is in the hospital,” the village headman explains. “He is still alive, but the driver left the scene and there is no one to pay the medical expenses.” Ashura and her mother rush to the hospital. “Dad! Dad!” When Ashura sees her sick father, her heart breaks. “Love ... how did this happen? ” Her mother starts weeping when she sees her husband. Her father also starts crying when he sees his wife and Ashura. Ashura wants to comfort her father and mother. “Mommy and Daddy, do not cry. We are good people, so good things will happen soon, as long as we don’t lose hope!” Suddenly, her dad is horribly angry at her and says “Ashura! Stop telling us everything will turn out fine. I was hit by a car, and you are still saying everything will be okay!” Ashura is distraught, but she stays with her father until he falls asleep. She then leaves the hospital to go to a big tree growing at the entrance to the village. She prays, “God, my father got hurt, and he is very sick. I just wanted to give him hope, but Imade him angry. What should I do?” “Hello kid!” she hears someone calling her. When she turns around, there is a man wearing a suit standing behind her. “I am not familiar with this town. Is there a hospital around here?” he asks. “Yes, there is a hospital. Follow me. I will take you there.” Ashura speaks to him on the way to the hospital. “You are wearing a nice suit. You also look smart and kind so can I ask you something?” He smiles at her and says, “What are you wondering? Let’s hear it.” Ashura asks him, “My teacher says that things are never as good or as bad as they seem. Even though bad things happen, if we don’t lose our hope and fight through it, everything will turn out fine. Is this true?” “Of course! It is up to you all along. No matter how difficult a situation is, if we try hard without losing hope and remain honest, everything will turn out fine. I grew up in a refugee shelter but Iam thankful for every day of my life. I never gave up and worked very hard, and so now I own a company. If I felt bitter about my poor situation in the refugee shelter and never tried, I would never have been able to achieve my dream and own my company,” he answers. They are still talking when they arrive at the hospital. “So if I don’t lose hope, everything will turn out fine, right? Ah! What a relief. Thank you very much for talking with me. Here we are. This is the hospital. My father is here in the first room.” Ashura looks through the window at her father. The man in the suit turns to look and sees Ashura’s father. There is a surprised look on his face and he suddenly runs to the bathroom. Ashura looks at him and thinks, “He is a nice person. I hope he is not here because something bad has happened…” The man in the suit, Aron, runs to the bathroom and locks the door. “How could I have caused this terrible car accident? Ashura is a kind-hearted girl and I hit her father and ran away.” He punches the wall with one hand and cries while clamping his mouth with the other. He feels very regretful. Aron is a businessman who trades nuts. A few days ago, he was on the way to sign a contract and got lost on an unfamiliar street. He hit a person with his car and unwittingly fled because he was so scared. After the accident, Aron could not eat and sleep. He was overwhelmed by his guilt and returned to the scene of the crime. He decides that he would go and apologize for his mistake. However, he is very scared and cannot bring himself to leave the bathroom. After one hour, he hears someone knocking on his door and comes back to reality. It is still difficult for him to face Ashura’s father. Then he remembers Ashura’s clear eyes when he met her at the entrance to the village. He finally finds the heart to tell the truth and walks to the room where Ashura’s father is recovering. He confesses his mistakes and asks for forgiveness. “I am sincerely sorry for everything. I will do everything to help you recover and start working again. Don’t worry about the medical expenses. Once you get out of the hospital, I will open a store in the city. Also, if you allow me, Iwould love to pay Ashura’s school fees until she finishes her college degree. I know it is not enough to ask for forgiveness, but I will try my best. I am truly sorry, please forgive me.” Aron looks at Ashura’s father kneeling down and asking for forgiveness. Ashura starts to cry. The family forgives Aron. After six months, her father and mother open a clothing boutique. Aron comes every weekend to make suits with his friends. He also never forgets to bring fairytale books and candy for Ashura. Tomorrow, Ashura will start her studies at a great school that has the best dormitory in Tanzania. Aron bought a red school bag and English dictionary for her. Ashura promises that she will study very hard and will become an inspiration to all children in Tanzania. Most of all, she will never lose hope.",

    "story": "Once upon a time, there was a small village. Many of the people in the village were very poor. One of the men in the village was named Mr. Mshamu. Mr. Mshamu had three children: Hamiss, Hadija, and Karim. Their family was very poor and they had no car and no farm. Mr. Mshamu knew that education was very important, so he worked hard to send his kids to school. He hoped that one day, his kids would get good jobs to help bring their family out of poverty. But Hadija got married young and could not continue (his/her) education. Hamiss did not work hard in school and ended up on the streets. Mr. Mshamu’s last hope was Karim. Mr. Mshamu gave Karim lots of support and made sure that he worked hard in school so that he could go to college one day and help his family. Karim was a very kind and intelligent child and his teachers loved him. As time went on, Karim made two new friends: Hassan and Yasa. Hassan and Yasa were the sons of the village leader and were very rich and spoiled, but they bought Karim nice things. Hassan and Yasa were a bad influence on Karim. He started to skip classes and lie to his parents. Mr. Mshamu and Karim’s teachers were very disappointed in him. They tried to help him become a good boy again, but Karim kept getting into trouble. Karim became so much trouble that he was expelled from school. Mr. Mshamu was heartbroken over the failure of his last child. Life became harder for the Mshamu family and they had less money. They could not take care of Karim anymore, so he ended up on the street like his brother, Hamiss. Karim had turned into a monster. He caused so much trouble that even Hassan and Yasa did not want to be near him. Karim bullied kids and took their money. With each bad thing Karim did, his face changed. Every time he saw his reflection, he looked scarier and scarier. Karim became so worried about his appearance that he went home one day to ask his parents for help. “Did I do something wrong?” he asked his parents. “Think about your actions, Karim. Do you think you did something wrong?” they replied. Karim sat down and thought about all of the bad things he had done. He felt guilty and sad about all of the pain he had caused people. When he looked in the mirror in his house, he was shocked by what he saw. In the mirror was the scariest and ugliest monster he had ever seen. He began to cry and immediately regretted all of the bad things he had done. He had let down his parents, his teachers, and his friends. He began to pray to God for mercy. Karim decided that he needed to apologize to everyone he had hurt. He apologized to the kids he had bullied and they gladly accepted his apology. Then something strange happened. His appearance started to go back to normal. He apologized to his teachers and his appearance changed even more. And finally, he apologized to his parents. “I am so sorry for all of the pain I have caused you. Will you please forgive me?” he asked. “Of course, Karim. We are so proud that you have learned your lesson. We love you,” his parents answered.’ “Thank you for your love,” said Karim, smiling. Karim’s face went completely back to normal. In fact, it shined as bright as the sun. Ever since, Karim has been kind and giving. He now has a very bright future ahead of him.",

    "story": "Most people in Tanzania have not heard of Ifakara. It was its own hidden, isolated world and it was also my home. Most of the people who are born in Ifakara never leave, but I was one of the exceptions. I have four siblings: an older sister, and older brother, and two younger sisters. As a child, Ilonged to go to school and I finally persuaded my parents to let me go. And so, I started school when I was six years old. The minimum school starting age in Tanzania at the time was seven for standard one, but my teachers let me in anyway because I was such an eager student. I enjoyed learning very much. Iknew that if I wanted to go as far with my education as possible, I would need to learn about the world beyond Ifakara. Luckily, I had a special window to the outside world. There was a television mounted in a street café near my house where I met countless new characters. I especially loved a character named Dexter from a show called Dexter’s Laboratory. He was interested in nature, science, and design, and he was the smallest in his class. He was also not the most popular kid in school, so I could relate to him. Dexter taught me about how science can be used to solve problems and I knew I wanted to be like him when I grew up. Because of my outstanding performance in school and unanimous recommendations from all of my teachers, after standard four Iwas selected to attend a boarding school with a full scholarship. My new school was much more interesting and challenging than my old school. I was finally able to take science classes in secondary school, just like Dexter. I had fallen in love with science. I started reading books and any materials Icould find related to science. I read about topics such as quantum physics and astrophysics that even my teachers could not explain to me. My final year of secondary school, I pursued my first science and engineering project on sustainable alternative energy sources. I had learned about global warming in a science magazine and came up with a biogas project. In Ifakara, most households use firewood and charcoal as primary fuel, but these sources are very cumbersome and far from ecologically sustainable. However, many people in Ifakara are animal herders and I had the idea to use the manure from the cows as a biogas energy source because there was so much of it and it would never run out. I then spent my last quarter of secondary school learning about how to break down the manure to harness the methane gas for energy. Since I didn’t have access to the Internet, I spent most of my time reading in the library to find everything I could on the subject. When I graduated secondary school, I spent all of my time working on my project. Iperformed many experiments and finally came up with a final idea for a model. My only problem was that I didn’t have the money to make it happen and I couldn’t get more money from my sponsors. I started writing letters to people to help me pay for my project. I even dared to apply to universities abroad to further my education. Finally, after two years of hard work, I received a response from Stanford University, one of the best universities in the United States. Stanford was an amazing place. Before coming to Stanford, I thought Dexter was the only other curious person in the whole world. On the contrary, I found more people like Dexter at Stanford. These people, who are now my friends, are also interested in science and enjoy finding solutions to problems. My first year at Stanford, I made a friend named Hari and we worked together to create tools for efficient, cost-effective diagnosis of Malaria. My second year, I made another friend named Runi and we are studying HIV. I have learned that the one thing better than being a Dexter is finding other Dexters to work with. I still have a long way to go before I discover or invent something new, but I know that one day, with hard work, I can create something that will be useful to my country. However, I know one thing: I have become the Dexter that I have always wanted to be. And as long as I don’t give up, I know that I can help change the world.",

    "story": "Once, in a village in India called Chandra Babu Nagar, there lived a girl named Sasikala. She lived with her parents and two older brothers. They were very poor. They had difficulty finding money and had to work really hard. Sasikala’s family lived right next to a cheese making farm. Sasikala’s mother had a friend who worked there and she gave Sasikala’s family the crumbs that were left over from making the cheese. The family appreciated this very much because they all enjoyed the cheese from the dairy farm even the cheese that was a little old. Sasikala’s father loved the cheese the most. But Sasikala had one major problem: her father’s anger. Her father would go to the bar and drink. Sometimes, he came home drunk and did not realize what he was doing. He would be very threatening and mean to his children. Sasikala and her brothers were very frightened of him. At night, Sasikala’s father would ask for more beers. Sasikala rushed to get the drinks before her father beat Sasikala’s mother. Sasikala’s father always yelled at his wife for no reason. Sasikala and her brothers always watched him in silence, too afraid to even whisper. Their mother would have to go to a friend’s house to escape from their father. Sasikala’s father wasn’t angry all the time. He would switch back and forth between being angry and calm for no apparent reason. Sasikala and her brothers began to investigate the causes of their father’s angry moods. After school, they walked barefoot all the way to a big internet café in the town of Kuduru. They didn’t know how to use computers. They didn’t even know any English, but they desperately wanted to help their father. They used a dictionary to translate websites. They read lots of medical articles and searched and searched to find the cause of their father’s symptoms. After spending an entire month reading and searching both day and night, they still didn’t have an answer for their father’s behavior. Sasikala’s brothers lost hope and stopped searching. They told Sasikala, “It’s just the way father is, and we have to accept it and live with it until we die.” But Sasikala, after reading and learning all those new things, still believed that her father’s mood swings were because of a health issue. Sasikala was sitting at the internet café one day and feeling very sad because she still hadn’t found out what was causing her father’s symptoms. She was about to start crying in front of the computer when she came across an article about eating habits and health. She started to read. The author recommended recording what a patient eats and how it affects their mood. Sasikala went back home with lots of hope. She monitored and jotted down everything her father ate. She took notes for two weeks and matched her notes to the times when her father was angry. Finally, she figured it out! She realized that whenever her father eats cheese he becomes angry and mad, then gets drunk and beats his family. It was a rainy afternoon, but Sasikala was so excited about her findings that she ran all the way to the internet café in the rain. She wanted to see if eating cheese and mood swings were indeed related. She got there a few minutes before it closed. Sasikala looked on a medical website to find the name of the sickness. She found it! She discovered that headaches and anger could be caused by Tyramine, a compound often found in old cheese. Sasikala was so happy that she ran all the way back home. When she got home it was late. She was shaking from the cold but deep inside she felt warm because of her great discovery. Her father scolded her because she was late. Sasikala tried to explain to her father, but he wouldn’t listen. Sasikala decided to do the experiment all by herself, because she loved her father so much. She convinced her mom not to get any cheese from their neighbors for two weeks. Her father was constantly complaining, “Why don’t we get cheese anymore?” Finally, Sasikala explained to her father what she was trying to do and he agreed to participate. After spending two weeks without eating any cheese or drinking old milk, Sasikala’s father did not have any Tyramine left in his body. The whole family was surprised that their father didn’t get angry anymore! Sasikala’s hard work and persistence had finally cured her father! The family was very proud of Sasikala’s work and they told their neighbors the story of how she had cured her father. Sasikala wrote about her experiment and submitted the report to the free clinic director, Dr. Thumo. Dr. Thumo gave Sasikala an “Excellent Scientist” award and sponsored Sasikala’s education with the help of his friend Kakama. Sasikala was encouraged by Dr.",

    "story": "”Ajia! Afua!, Abbas! Is this what you guys did??!” Neema shouted with her angry voice. She was showing the kids a bucket full of mixed eggs, beans, and vegetables. The three kids who were spraying paints all over the wall in the basement froze and didn’t know what to do or say. Soon they realized that they were in big trouble. The youngest son Abbas looked at her mom and said, “Mom- ” with the most warmest voice and biggest smile in his face. Neema was still wearing the stern face. She couldn’t believe what she just saw and what the children did. “Ajia, Afua, and Abbas, these were precious food that was supposed to be eaten by the children in the orphanage. They rarely have such food to eat, and you children just had to ruin it because of your inconsiderate thoughts and selfishness.” The children couldn’t talk as if their lips were glued, and they started to regret what they just did. Neema didn’t want to scold her children, but she knew she must because she wanted her children to open their eyes to the people living in difficult situations. “Children, this food is like gold to these orphans. And today, you three just destroyed their gold,” Neema said. “Then what will happen to them?”, the youngest one asked in a quiet voice. “What do you think, Abbas?”, Neema asked with a motherly tone this time. Abbas faced the ground and didn’t lift his head. He then said, “The children won’t be able to have the good food, so they will be sad. “ It seemed the twin sisters still didn’t understand the seriousness of the situation. “But mom, painting was really fun”, the twins whined. Neema sighed. She understood that her children were still young and that they needed more attentive guidance. Neema faced the twin, lowering her body to match their eye level, and asked, “Ajia, Afua, why do you think mother goes to the orphanage every Wednesday?” The twins looked at each other then said in a smaller voice, “Because mommy was able to be a teacher from the help of the villagers when mommy was young.” “Correct. So what do you do when you are helped?” Neema asked the twins. “Help the children in need…,” Afua said. It relieved Neema that her children were starting to understand and feel sorry. “Yes, Afua. We need to help the children in need, and providing food to the children is a way of helping them.” Neema said. She patted her daughter’s head and stood up, and said to herself, “It’s almost Christmas and now it seems like the children won’t be having their very special meal this year. What to do now, children. What to do.” Neema rested her hand on her forehead and shook her head sideways. The siblings heard what their mother said, and started to feel even more sorry for the children. “What should we do now? The children won’t be able to have their Christmas dinner because of our mistake. It’s all our fault.” Heavy teardrops trickled down Abba’s round cheeks. “Wait! I have an idea! ”, Ajia suddenly shouted. Ayellow lightbulb lit in Ajia’s head. She told her siblings to wait and she came back with her piggy bank. She then gathered her siblings and shared her brilliant idea. “Do you remember when mommy told us that she wanted a young goat when she was young? Would’nt we be able to buy one if we put our piggy bank savings together?, Ajia said enthusiastically. “Ajia, you are a genius! That is a brilliant idea! We could sell the baby goats when the goat grows older. With the money, we then can buy food for the children.”, the other twin said. Abbas clapped his head and jumped around in joy. He was even pretending to be a baby goat. “Meeehhhhh~ Meeeeehhhh~” The three siblings expressed their joy by giggling while drawing big smiles on their faces. The three siblings hurriedly went to the market and searched for a young goat. But the youngest sibling, Abbas, seemed to only see the sweet candy displayed in the market. “I want a candy. Can I get one, please?”, Abbas pleaded. The twins saw the candy too, and it almost felt like their tongue was a centimeter away from tasting the sugary candy. But they both shook their head sideways and said, “No, Abbas. This is the money for the goat. Come one, let’s go” The twins held their youngest sibling’s hands and continued searching for the young goat. The three siblings expressed their joy by giggling while drawing big smiles on their faces. The siblings finally found a goat shop and looked for the best one to take back home. The goat owner greeted the children with a big smile and asked, “What brings you little ones here to my shop” “Hello, Mister. We are here to buy a young goat. Today, we played with the food our mother was going to give to the orphanage for Christmas. Now, there is no more food for the children. We decided to use our money to buy a goat, and sell its babies and use the money to buy the food for the children.”, Ajia explained to the owner. “You are very kind, aren’t you? I am pretty sure your mother will be so proud. Here, follow me. I’ll pick the best goat for you children to take home.” The children followed the owner and shouted, “It must be the best goat!” The owner and the children chuckled, and the man was very fond of the children’s kind hearts. “Oh goodness!” the owner said after receiving money from the children and counting the bills. The children were suddenly worried that they didn’t have enough money. This was all they had and they couldn’t afford to go back home without a goat. “Why mister, is it not enough?”, Ajia asked with a worried tone. “Oh, why no! You little ones gave me too much. This is more than enough to buy two young goats. Why don’t you children enjoy a little snack on the way home with the change”, the owner said with a grin so big, making the man’s eyes very thin. “Phew! Thank goodness we had enough money”, Ajiah said to her siblings. The children were so excited that they were able to purchase a goat. Abbas showed his little white teeth and was looking forward to tasting the sweet candy he wanted on his way. “You little ones make sure you go home safe, alright? Give me your pinkies and promise me that you will”, the owner said. “We will mister. We promise!” The siblings offered their pinkies and the owner crossed his pinky with each of theirs. “Oh wait. Mister, we didn’t ask what your name was. Could you tell us your name so that we can tell our mother who the nice owner was?”, Ajia asked. “Why, of course I can! My name is Suma. Now you little ones, go along and make your mother happy,” Mister Suma said. “Yes, Mister Suma! Thank you so much!”, the children answered. The children held each other’s hand and hopped back home happily. Mister Suma smiled while watching the children leave. He was a very kind and generous man. The children’s money was in fact not enough to even buy a young goat, but he pretended that it was. He saw the children’s innocent and pristine heart and he wanted to give the goat as a gift, reminding him of his young childhood. “Oh my goodness!”, When Neema was coming from school and opened the house gate, she flinched at an unusual sound coming from her yard. “Meeehhhhh~ Meeehhhhh” When Neema turned to see where the sound was coming from, she was surprised to see two young goats in her yard. The goats were not scary, but just didn’t expect one to see them in her own yard. “Mom! Mom!” The children were running to greet her. “Mom, today we went to the market, and with our savings, we bought two young goats!”, Ajiah said. Neema’s eyes grew wide. She couldn’t believe that her three young children bought two goats. “You three went to the market by yourselves and bought goats?” “Yes! We are going to sell the goat’s baby goats and buy the orphanage food for children’s Christmas dinner. We also promised Mister Suma!” the two enthusiastic twins said. Neema recalled her younger childhood memories when she used to sell young goats. She remembered how young she was liker her children. She chuckled at the thought and looked at her children playing with each other. She smiled at Ajia, Afua, and Abbas and was overjoyed by their warm innocent hearts and thoughtfulness wanting to help the orphanage by selling baby goats. Neema also felt very grateful to Mister Suma because she knew that the children’s money was not even enough to buy one young goat. “Thank you so much, children. You are so kind and so sweet. When mommy was about your age, mommy too thought of selling 100 young goats and going to school with the money. But of course, mommy soon realized that it was difficult to even handle one goat. But with you little helpers, perhaps we can! Couldn’t we? “Yes! Yes!” the siblings shouted and jumped. “I guess my dream was going to be true after all. We are going to make sure the children have their Christmas dinner. Promise?”’ “Promise!” The siblings gave their pinkies to their mother.

    "story": "In one African village called Masagna, there lived a young boy whose name was Suma. Suma was the only child and he lived with his parents. He was known for causing a lot of trouble and problems around the village, and because of his reckless behavior, he was expelled from his school. After being expelled, he did more thoughtless and rash actions with his free time without any sense of guilt. Suma often stole his father’s wallet and wasted his day by hanging out with his bad friends stealing from other people’s homes. His patient mother and father were very upset and were worried about his future. The villagers gathered together and started to bad mouth and criticize Suma. “I don’t understand how such a child like Suma was born from that kind and generous couple. It is truly a shame”, one man said in disbelief, shaking his head sideways. Suma’s parents prayed day and night in hopes that their child, Suma, would change and be a kind and a nice boy. Unfortunately, Suma never changed. The Masagna villagers pitied Suma’s parents. When they visit Suma’s mother to comfort her, she would face the ground and shed tears. One day, Suma was on a trip to a different village in a search to steal new goods. On his way, he spotted a girl from another village and Suma was instantly attracted to her beautiful looks. Suma followed the girl, and as the boy as he is, he believed that he would be able to make her his girlfriend. “Hey!”, Suma called the girl and walked towards her. The girl turned around to see who was calling her and saw a boy approaching. When Suma got near the girl, he introduced himself to her. “Hi. My name is Suma. I saw you walking down the road and I thought you would want some company on your way. What is your name?”, Suma said and asked enthusiastically. “Oh, hi. My name is Neema”, Neema said hesitatingly. “ Umm look, I am in a hurry right now so it would be best if I go alone. Thanks anyway and it was nice seeing you, Suma”, she said and started to walk away in a fast pace. Suma was surprised by Neema’s answer. He thought she was going to accept his offer and this made Suma a little upset. “What? Hey, hold on a second!”, Suma shouted and quickly grabbed her wrist. Neema suddenly felt a sharp pain on her left wrist, and felt uncomfortable with Suma’s behavior. “My mother is waiting for me on the other side of the village. I must go quickly. Please, could you let go of my arm?” Neema said with sternness. However, the selfish and self-centered Suma didn’t care what Neema said. Instead he steadied his gaze on her face with a playful look and grabbed her arm stronger. Evil thoughts started to fill his mind. “I understand, but I have something to say to you. Ineed you to follow me to my village” Suma said with a bit of harshness and pulled her arm to his direction. Neema understanding the dangerous situation quickly pulled her arm away and started crying and running away from Suma. Suma got extremely angry and started running to get her, reaching out his arms. A man called Hosea walking with his daughter, Hadassah, saw what was happening and knew that the girl was in trouble. Not going any further, Neema tripped on a rock and fell. She turned her head and saw Suma approaching and getting close to her. Suma was breathing heavily and was wearing a scary face. Neema being terrified started to scream out for help. “Help! Help! Please, anyone! Please, just help me!” Neema screamed. Hosea and Hadassah heard Neema’s scream and they both ran as fast as possible to her. The other villagers also heard Neema’s scream and quickly approached to where Neema was. Suma seeing the people approaching, he hurriedly fled the scene. When Hosea and his daughter reached the place, they assured Neema and assisted her to the hospital. It was a late night and Suma was captured by the villagers. He was sent to the police station and the people testified that Suma was a criminal that stole people’s valuable possessions and was attempting to commit sexual abuse on Neema. Suma was immediately sent to prison with other prisoners. Suma’s life in prison was miserable and terrifying. With no guard watching over them, the ruthless prisoners would beat up Suma and leave bruises and cuts on his body. The prisoners also stole his clothes and his food from him. Bomp! Bomp! Bo-. Suma held one of the prisoner’s fist. Suma’s face was covered in blood and bruises, and his lips were torn from the countless punches. “Please...stop. I would do anything. Please, just don’t kill me”, Suma pleaded to his cell mates. There were terror in his eyes, and Suma couldn’t endure the pain any longer. The prisoners laughed and one prisoner squeezed Suma’s face and forced Suma to look at him. “You filthy thing. If you want to live, I suggest you go crawl into that corner and never make a sound because if you do, I will make sure that you beg me to kill you instead”, the strongest prisoner said. The prisoner punched his face one last time and spat at him. The prisoner left and went back to their cells. Suma never experienced such horror in his life. On the other side, Suma’s parents were worried ill and didn’t know where their son was. Their son was missing for days and didn’t have one clue where Suma could be. “Honey, don’t worry too much. Suma will be back soon…”, Suma’s father said and quietly assured his wife. Suma’s parents were afraid that their only son left the village with his bad friends. The only thing they could do was to pray to God for their son’s safety and that Suma would come back home safe and alive. Suma was hiding in the corner in his cell and did not make any noise like he was instructed. He hasn’t had any food for days, and he truly started to believe that he was going to die in prison. ‘Am I going to die in here?’, Suma thought. ‘I have been stealing from other people and breaking my parent’s hearts. Neema was such a beautiful girl. Why did I hurt and scare her? What have I done. I am paying for my own sins, and I will continue to do so after I die when I go to hell. Will even God forgive me?’, Suma questioned himself and buried his face into his knees. Three weeks have passed, and Suma was released from prison. He was granted an early release without a trial because he was still a minor. Suma didn’t feel any relief after being released from prison. He felt ashamed for his crimes, and he had nowhere to go. “Who would accept a wretch like me…” Suma said quietly to himself. “I can’t even go back to my own parents...how can I? After what I have done to them and to the villagers. Someone like me shouldn’t even beg for forgiveness.”,thought Suma, roaming around the streets. Suma was walking down the street until he noticed a familiar face. It was Hosea, the man that helped Neema to the hospital three weeks ago. Suma immediately felt nervous and ashamed. He imagined the man grabbing him and sending him back to prison. “Suma”, the man called. Suma didn’t know whether he should look up or down. He was scared to face the eyes of the man. “Suma”, the man called again. “Let me see your face”. Suma slowly lifted his chin to face the man, preparing himself for the horror he will be facing. When he saw the man’s face, Suma twitched for a quick second. He didn’t look scary or have the mean eyes. The man’s eyes were gently bent downwards, making fine lines underneath his eyes. His brown lips pushing his cheekbones upwards. “Where are you heading?”, Hosea asked. Suma was silent. He didn’t have an answer to that question. He knew he should quickly answer because the man was waiting, but that man seemed to already know what his answer was. He still had that gentle smile on his face. “I...don’t know”, Suma said with a quiet voice. “Do you have a home? What about your parents?”, the man prompted. “My parents are home. But it is not a place for me to go back to.”, Suma answered. Hosea’s brows slightly shifted inwards. He didn’t understand Suma’s answer. “I have done terrible and unforgivable things. Things Ishould have not done. I can’t go back to my village and my home. How can I ask my parents for forgiveness after what I have done to them”, Suma said with grief. “Suma, listen”, the man said. “Your parents will forgive you. You are their loving son. Even if you have done regretful things in the past, the present is only important. Have some courage and go back to your parent’s arms. And when you go back, be a changed young man.” The man brought back the smile he wore when he first called Suma. It gave Suma the courage to answer. “I will.”, Suma said. Suma didn’t forget to return the smile. Suma has been wandering around the streets for a couple of days, filling himself with edible food he could find from the garbage. The confidence he had when he talked with Hosea seemed to have evaporated. Today, Suma was determined to go back home. He started walking towards his house. From a distance, Suma’s parents recognized their son. “Suma!”, his mother shouted. Suma’s mother and father ran toward their son, and held him very close to their hearts. Tears ran down through his mother’s cheeks. “Thank you, God! Thank you for protecting my son and bringing him back home safely”, Suma’s father quietly said embracing his family. Suma was no longer the reckless boy from the past. He was a changed boy like he promised Hosea. He was ashamed for all the trouble he caused to the villagers and his friends. “Mother and Father, I am very sorry for causing so much trouble. I was a son that only fought everyday and stole from our neighbor’s homes. I am truly sorry, please forgive me”, Suma said facing the ground. It didn’t take a second for Suma’s parents to immediately hold their son’s small shoulders with both their arms. They forgave their son entirely at once. From that day on, Suma was reborn. He was determined to study and go back to school again and he even helped his parents with house chores. Six months later, Suma went to Neema’s place to apologize to her and ask for forgiveness. Suma’s parents were very proud with their changed son, and soon the villagers started to notice Suma’s changed behavior. Everyone slowly forgave Suma and accepted him.",
