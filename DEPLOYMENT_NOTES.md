npx tsx prisma/seed-real-books.ts
```

### 2. PDF File Upload
Upload all PDF files from local `/Users/jihunkong/1001project/1001books` to:
```
server:/path/to/1001-stories/public/books/
```

### 3. Cover Image Generation
Generate cover images from PDF front covers:
```bash
# Create cover images from PDFs
for book in public/books/*/; do

  # Or use existing cover image files
done
```
