## Development Workflow

**⚠️ CRITICAL NEW WORKFLOW (2025-09-19) - MANDATORY**

**Local Docker Test → Build Success → Then Git/Server Upload**

Never deploy or upload to server without first confirming local Docker build success. This prevents claiming server is running when it's actually broken.

### Mandatory Development Process
```bash
# 1. FIRST: Test locally in Docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d --build

# 2. Verify all services are running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ps
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs app

# 3. Test key functionality
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
npm run lint
npm run build

# 4. ONLY AFTER SUCCESS: Git operations
git add .
git commit -m "Description"
git push

# 5. ONLY AFTER GIT SUCCESS: Server deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed demo data
npx tsx prisma/seed-demo.ts

# Start development server (or use Docker)
npm run dev
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run Playwright tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific test
npx playwright test tests/landing-page.spec.ts
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to AWS EC2
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy

# Check deployment logs
./scripts/deploy.sh logs

# Rollback if needed
./scripts/deploy.sh rollback
```

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/1001stories"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"

# Email (Nodemailer)
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT="587"
EMAIL_SERVER_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
EMAIL_FROM="noreply@1001stories.org"

# AI Integration
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"  # For GPT image generation & TTS
UPSTAGE_API_KEY="your-upstage-api-key"  # For educational chatbot & parsing

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_AI_IMAGES="true"
ENABLE_TTS="true"
ENABLE_CHATBOT="true"
```

## Key Implementation Notes

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks role card → redirects to `/login` with callback URL
2. User enters email → magic link sent via Nodemailer
3. User clicks link → authenticated and redirected to dashboard
4. Middleware handles route protection and role-based access

### Demo Mode
- Separate `/demo` routes with sample data
- No authentication required
- Yellow banner indicates demo mode
- CTAs throughout to encourage signup

### Performance Optimizations
- Dynamic imports for code splitting
- Image optimization with Next.js Image
- Tailwind CSS for minimal CSS bundle
- PostgreSQL connection pooling with Prisma

## Code Style Guidelines

1. **TypeScript**: Use strict typing, avoid `any`
2. **Components**: Functional components with hooks
3. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utilities, avoid inline styles
4. **State**: React hooks for local, Zustand for global
5. **API**: RESTful routes in `/app/api`
6. **Database**: Prisma ORM with type-safe queries
7. **No Comments**: Don't add comments unless explicitly requested

## Common Commands

```bash
# Database
npx prisma studio         # Open Prisma Studio
npx prisma migrate dev    # Create migration
npx prisma generate       # Generate client
npx prisma db push       # Push schema changes

# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server
npm run build           # Build production
npm run lint            # Check code quality

# Docker
docker-compose up -d     # Start services
docker-compose down      # Stop services
docker-compose logs app  # View logs

# Deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy    # Deploy to production
./scripts/test-docker-local.sh # Test Docker locally
./scripts/setup-server.sh     # Initial server setup
```

## Important Files

- `middleware.ts` - Authentication and routing logic
- `lib/auth.ts` - NextAuth configuration
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- `docker-compose.yml` - Production deployment config
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Main deployment script
- `.env.production` - Production environment variables
- `.env.local` - Local development variables

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port conflicts**: Check if port 3000/3001 is in use
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

2. **Database connection**: Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

3. **Email not sending**: Check SMTP credentials and app password
   - Gmail requires app-specific password
   - Enable 2FA and generate app password

4. **Docker issues**: Clean restart
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

5. **Build errors**: Clear cache and rebuild
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next node_modules
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

## PDF.js Version Management (Critical)

### Problem Solved (2025-09-07)
- **Issue**: PDF.js version conflicts between `pdfjs-dist` (5.4.54) and `react-pdf` bundled version (4.8.69)
- **Symptoms**: 
  - "API version does not match Worker version" errors
  - "Cannot use the same canvas during multiple render() operations" 
  - "Invalid or unexpected token" in worker file

### Solution Applied
1. **Remove duplicate pdfjs-dist**: `npm uninstall pdfjs-dist --legacy-peer-deps`
2. **Use react-pdf's bundled version**: All imports from `react-pdf/node_modules/pdfjs-dist`
3. **Standardize worker file**: Use `/pdf.worker.min.mjs` everywhere
4. **Fix canvas conflicts**: Add render task cancellation in EnhancedPDFViewer
5. **Remove unused components**: Deleted PDFReaderWithThumbnails (627 lines of unused code)

### PDF Component Architecture
Keep these components:
- `SafePDFViewer` - Main production viewer with SSR safety
- `PDFViewer` - Simple demo viewer
- `SimplePDFThumbnail` - Basic thumbnails using react-pdf
- `EnhancedPDFThumbnail` - Advanced thumbnails with access control
- `EnhancedPDFViewer` - Feature-rich viewer (wrapped by SafePDFViewer)

### Worker Configuration
```javascript
// Correct configuration (use in all PDF components)
import { GlobalWorkerOptions } from 'react-pdf/node_modules/pdfjs-dist';
GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdf.worker.min.mjs';
```

## Important Reminders

1. **Always run lint before committing**
2. **Test authentication flow after changes**
3. **Update Playwright tests for UI changes**
4. **Don't add comments unless requested**
5. **Keep demo mode functional**
6. **Verify mobile responsiveness**
7. **Check Docker build before deploying**
8. **Never install pdfjs-dist directly - use react-pdf's bundled version**
9. **TTS Implementation** - If TTS generation fails, display error message only. NEVER use browser audio callbacks
10. **Docker Priority** - All development should be Docker-first, test locally in Docker environment
11. **PDF Location** - PDFs are stored in `/public/books/` directory
12. **Role Testing** - Always test with multiple roles when implementing features

## Critical Data Management Warning (2025-09-08)

**⚠️ NEVER replace dummy data without careful consideration**

When working with books and PDFs:
1. **Always backup existing data first** - Use database dumps or export scripts
2. **Test data changes in isolated environment** - Don't directly modify production-like data
3. **Preserve PDF functionality** - Ensure PDF reading, parsing, and thumbnail generation remain functional
4. **Use upsert instead of delete/create** - Prevents loss of existing relationships and references
5. **Run seed scripts carefully** - Different seed scripts serve different purposes:
   - `seed-sample-books.ts` - For demo/test data with working PDF samples
   - `seed-real-books.ts` - For selected real PDFs from public/books
   - `seed-all-books.ts` - For complete real PDF collection (31 books)
   - `update-real-books.ts` - For updating existing books with real PDF paths (use upsert)

**Recent incident**: Replacing dummy data with real PDFs broke PDF reading and parsing functionality. Always test thoroughly after data changes.

## CRITICAL MISTAKES TO AVOID (2025-09-19)

**⚠️ These mistakes have been repeatedly made. Each repetition wastes significant time and damages the project.**

### 1. Infrastructure Mistakes (STOP REPEATING)
- **nginx Configuration**: Always uncomment HTTPS server blocks, check SSL paths
- **Redis Service**: Ensure Redis is included in docker-compose.yml with proper password
- **SSL/HTTPS**: Use Let's Encrypt certificates, verify certificate paths exist
- **SMTP Settings**: Use app-specific passwords for Gmail, not regular passwords
- **Environment Variables**: Use relative paths in docker-compose, absolute paths in code
- **Docker Version**: NEVER specify version: "3.9" in docker-compose.yml (use v2 syntax)

### 2. Server Deployment Lies (CRITICAL)
- **NEVER claim server is running without testing**
- **ALWAYS test with `curl` commands and check actual responses**
- **Container status != working application**
- **Use new workflow: Local Docker → Build Success → Git → Server**

### 3. File Path Confusion (REPEATED ERROR)
- **Correct Path**: `/Users/jihunkong/1001project/1001-stories/`
- **Wrong Path**: `/Users/jihunkong/1001project/1001-stories/1001project/` (NEVER USE)
- **Server Symlink**: `/opt/1001-stories` → `/home/ubuntu/1001project`
- **Always verify paths before claiming files don't exist**

### 4. Publishing Workflow Issues
- **WRITER SUBMISSIONS**: PDF upload must NOT be required
- **Text Editor Only**: Writers should submit via rich text editor
- **PDF Generation**: AI should generate images for text-only stories
- **Never add PDF upload requirement to writer forms**

### 5. File Management Chaos
- **Stop creating duplicate docker-compose files** (test.yml, test-edu.yml, etc.)
- **Stop creating duplicate documentation** (PRD.md, PRD copy.md, etc.)
- **Archive old files instead of duplicating**
- **Use single source of truth for configurations**

### 6. Agent and Tool Usage
- **Always use appropriate agents for tasks** (serena mcp, etc.)
- **Use docker-playwright-tester for containerized testing**
- **Use security-auditor for security reviews**
- **Don't ignore available tools and agents**

### 7. Docker Compose Partial Service Restart (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ ALL Containers Down - Complete Server Failure (2025-11-04)**

**Most Recent Incident (2025-11-04 - SSR Language Deployment)**:
- **Problem**: After deploying SSR language changes, server was completely inaccessible
- **Discovery**: ALL Docker containers were DOWN (not a single container running)
- **Root Cause**: Previous deployment operations likely ran `docker compose down` but never completed `docker compose up -d`
- **Impact**: Complete service outage - HTTPS returned SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL

**Symptoms**:
```bash
# Server shows NO containers running
ssh ubuntu@3.128.143.122 "docker ps"
# CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
# (empty - no containers running at all)

# HTTPS health check fails completely
curl https://1001stories.seedsofempowerment.org/api/health
# curl: (35) error:02FFF036:system library:func(4095):Connection reset by peer
```

**Solution Applied**:
```bash
# Simply start all services
cd /home/ubuntu/1001-stories
docker compose up -d

# Verify all 7 containers started
docker ps
# Should show: nginx, app, postgres, redis, certbot, prometheus, node-exporter (7 containers)

# Test HTTPS endpoint
curl https://1001stories.seedsofempowerment.org/api/health
# Should return: 200
```

**Prevention Implemented (2025-11-04)**:
1. **Enhanced deploy.sh with verification**:
   - Added `verify_deployment()` function
   - Checks all required containers are running
   - Specifically verifies nginx (critical for HTTPS)
   - Tests HTTPS endpoint for 200 response
   - Automatic rollback on verification failure

2. **Mandatory verification checklist**:
   - ✅ Container status: All 5 required containers running
   - ✅ nginx check: CRITICAL for HTTPS access
   - ✅ No unhealthy/exited containers
   - ✅ HTTPS endpoint test: Must return 200

**⚠️ nginx 컨테이너 미실행 문제 - 반복적으로 발생 (2025-10-31)**

**문제**:
- 배포 시 `docker compose up -d --force-recreate app` 사용
- app 서비스만 재시작되어 nginx, certbot, prometheus, node-exporter가 시작되지 않음
- HTTPS 접속 불가 (curl 응답: 000)
- App 컨테이너는 정상이지만 외부 접속 차단됨

**증상**:
```bash
# 컨테이너 확인 시 nginx가 없음
docker ps
# Only shows: app, postgres, redis
# Missing: nginx, certbot, prometheus, node-exporter
```

**근본 원인**:
특정 서비스만 지정하면 다른 서비스는 시작되지 않음

**해결 방법**:
```bash
# ❌ 잘못된 방법
docker compose up -d --force-recreate app

# ✅ 올바른 방법 - 모든 서비스 시작
docker compose up -d

# 또는 특정 서비스만 재빌드하고 모든 서비스 시작
docker compose build app
docker compose up -d
```

**MANDATORY Deployment Verification (Updated 2025-11-04)**:
```bash
# Improved deploy.sh now automatically performs these checks:

# 1. Container Status Check
# - Verifies nginx, app, postgres, redis, certbot are all running
# - Fails if any required container is missing

# 2. nginx Verification (CRITICAL)
# - Specifically checks nginx container is running
# - HTTPS will not work without nginx

# 3. Unhealthy Container Detection
# - Checks for any unhealthy or exited containers

# 4. HTTPS Endpoint Test
# - Tests https://localhost/api/health
# - Must return 200 status code

# 5. Automatic Rollback
# - If any check fails, initiates automatic rollback
# - Prevents broken deployments from staying live
```

**Manual Verification Commands** (if needed):
```bash
# 1. 모든 컨테이너 상태 확인
docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'

# 2. nginx 포함 여부 확인
docker ps | grep nginx

# 3. HTTPS 접속 테스트
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://1001stories.seedsofempowerment.org/api/health
# 200 응답 확인

# 4. 필요시 전체 서비스 재시작
docker compose up -d
```

**Key Lessons Learned**:
1. **NEVER assume containers are running** - Always verify after deployment
2. **nginx is CRITICAL** - Service is inaccessible without it
3. **Automated verification is essential** - Manual checks are error-prone
4. **Rollback capability required** - Must be able to recover quickly
5. **Complete outages possible** - Not just partial service failures

### Accountability Warning
- **Repeated mistakes are not accidents - they indicate systematic problems**
- **Each mistake costs significant time and delays the project**
- **Follow the documented processes and learn from previous failures**
- **Use Local Docker → Build Success → Git → Server workflow ALWAYS**

## SSL Certificate Setup (CRITICAL - 2025-11-04)

**⚠️ SSL Restoration Procedures - Documented from Production Incident**

### Initial SSL Certificate Generation

If SSL certificates are missing or need regeneration, use:

```bash
# Method 1: Automated script (Recommended)
./scripts/setup-ssl.sh

# Method 2: Manual generation
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh certbot -c "certbot certonly \
  --webroot -w /var/www/certbot \
  -d 1001stories.seedsofempowerment.org \
  --email noreply@1001stories.org \
  --agree-tos --non-interactive"

# Restart services to apply certificates
docker compose restart nginx
docker compose up -d --force-recreate certbot
```

### Improved docker-compose.yml Certbot Service

**Problem Solved (2025-11-04)**:
- Original certbot entrypoint was infinite renewal loop
- Caused `docker compose run certbot [command]` to hang indefinitely
- Made initial certificate generation impossible

**Solution Applied**:
Modified certbot service entrypoint to check for existing certificates before starting renewal daemon:

```yaml
certbot:
  entrypoint: |
    /bin/sh -c '
      # Check if SSL certificates exist
      if [ ! -d "/etc/letsencrypt/live/1001stories.seedsofempowerment.org" ]; then
        echo "⚠️  No SSL certificates found!"
        echo "Please run initial certificate generation first."
        exit 1
      fi

      echo "✅ SSL certificates found. Starting renewal daemon..."
      trap exit TERM
      while :; do
        certbot renew --webroot -w /var/www/certbot --quiet
        sleep 12h & wait ${!}
      done
    '
```

### SSL Certificate Verification

```bash
# Test HTTPS endpoint
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://1001stories.seedsofempowerment.org/api/health
# Should return: 200

# Check certificate expiry
openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in certbot/conf/live/1001stories.seedsofempowerment.org/cert.pem
# Example: notAfter=Feb  2 03:15:33 2026 GMT

# View certbot logs
docker compose logs certbot --tail=30
# Should show: "✅ SSL certificates found. Starting renewal daemon..."
```

### Troubleshooting SSL Issues

**Issue**: HTTPS not working / nginx crash loop
```bash
# 1. Check certificate files exist
ls -la certbot/conf/live/1001stories.seedsofempowerment.org/
# Should have: fullchain.pem, privkey.pem, cert.pem, chain.pem

# 2. Verify nginx config
docker exec 1001-stories-nginx nginx -t
# Should show: "syntax is ok" and "test is successful"

# 3. Check nginx logs
docker compose logs nginx --tail=50
```

**Issue**: Certbot renewal failing
```bash
# Check certbot can reach Let's Encrypt
docker exec 1001-stories-certbot wget -O- https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
# Should return JSON response

# Verify ACME challenge path accessible
curl http://1001stories.seedsofempowerment.org/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
# nginx should serve this path
```

**Issue**: Deploy script deleted SSL certificates
- **Root Cause**: `rsync --delete` removed certbot directory not in git
- **Prevention**: Deploy script updated with `--exclude=certbot` and `--exclude=public/generated-images`
- **Recovery**: Run `./scripts/setup-ssl.sh` to regenerate certificates

### Certificate Auto-Renewal

- Certificates valid for 90 days
- Auto-renewal runs every 12 hours (certbot container)
- Renewal triggers when <30 days remaining
- No manual intervention required for renewals
