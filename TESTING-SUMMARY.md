## Quick Start Testing Guide

### Option A: npm run dev (Quick Visual Testing)

**Best for:** Rapid UI verification, design review, component testing
**Time:** 2-5 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Node.js, npm installed

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/jihunkong/1001project/1001-stories

# 2. Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials

# 4. Start development server
npm run dev

# 5. Open browser
open http://localhost:3000/dashboard/volunteer

# 6. Test with hot reload - make changes and see them instantly
```

**Pros:**
- Fast startup (10-15 seconds)
- Hot module replacement for instant feedback
- Easy debugging with browser DevTools
- No Docker overhead

**Cons:**
- Not production-like environment
- Missing nginx, Redis, full PostgreSQL setup
- Some features may behave differently

---

### Option B: Docker Local (Full Integration Testing)

**Best for:** Production-like testing, full feature validation, E2E tests
**Time:** 5-10 minutes (includes build time)
**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop installed and running

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/jihunkong/1001project/1001-stories

# 2. Check Docker status
docker --version
docker compose version

# 3. Start Docker Desktop if not running
open -a Docker
# Wait for Docker to be ready (check menu bar icon)

# 4. Clean previous containers and build fresh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down -v
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml build --no-cache

# 5. Start all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d

# 6. Monitor startup logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f app

# 7. Wait for "ready started server on 0.0.0.0:3000" message

# 8. Health check
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health

# 9. Open application
open http://localhost:8001/dashboard/volunteer

# 10. Run automated tests (optional)
docker exec 1001-stories-app-local npx playwright test volunteer-dashboard-redesign
```

**Pros:**
- Production-like environment
- All services (PostgreSQL, Redis, nginx)
- SSL/HTTPS configuration
- Isolated from local machine

**Cons:**
- Slower startup time
- Requires Docker resources (4GB RAM minimum)
- More complex troubleshooting

---

### Option C: Production Server (Final Deployment Testing)

**Best for:** Pre-release validation, stakeholder demos, acceptance testing
**Time:** Immediate (if server running)
**Prerequisites:** VPN access (if required), server credentials

```bash
# 1. Verify server is running
curl https://1001stories.seedsofempowerment.org/api/health

# 2. Open production URL
open https://1001stories.seedsofempowerment.org/dashboard/volunteer

# 3. Use test accounts
# Email: volunteer@test.com
# Password: (check secure credentials document)

# 4. Run smoke tests
# - Login
# - Navigate all menu items
# - Submit test story
# - Check notifications
# - Logout

# 5. Run production Playwright tests
npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.prod.ts
```

**Pros:**
- Real production environment
- Actual performance metrics
- Real SSL certificates
- Production database

**Cons:**
- Can't use for destructive testing

#### Failed Test Example

```
Running 25 tests using 3 workers

  ✓ 23 passed (5m 45s)
  ✗ 2 failed (35s)

Failures:

  1) [chromium] › volunteer-dashboard-redesign.spec.ts:16:5 › Desktop View Tests › LNB sidebar navigation components render correctly

    Error: Timed out 5000ms waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible()

    Locator: [data-testid="volunteer-lnb"]
    Expected: visible
    Received: hidden

    Call log:
      - expect.toBeVisible with timeout 5000ms
      - waiting for locator('[data-testid="volunteer-lnb"]')

  2) [chromium] › volunteer-dashboard-redesign.spec.ts:74:5 › Desktop View Tests › All 9 Figma components render without errors

    Error: expect(received).toHaveLength(expected)

    Expected length: 0
    Received length: 1
    Received array: ["TypeError: Cannot read property 'stats' of undefined"]
```

**How to debug:**

1. **Check the specific test file:**
```bash
# Run only the failed test
npx playwright test volunteer-dashboard-redesign:16 --headed --debug
```

2. **Review the screenshot:**
- Navigate to `test-results/` directory
- Open the failure screenshot
- Compare with expected design

3. **Check component implementation:**
```bash
# Find the component file
find components -name "VolunteerLNB*"

# Read the component
cat components/volunteer/VolunteerLNB.tsx
```

4. **Verify data-testid exists:**
```bash
grep -r "data-testid=\"volunteer-lnb\"" components/
```

5. **Check for JavaScript errors:**
- Look in Docker logs: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs app`
- Check browser console in headed mode

---

#### Common Test Failures and Fixes

**1. Element not visible timeout**
```
Error: Timed out waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible()
```

**Causes:**
- Component not rendered due to missing data
- CSS display:none or visibility:hidden
- Element outside viewport
- Wrong test-id attribute

**Fixes:**
```bash
# Increase timeout
await expect(element).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 });

# Wait for network idle first
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');

# Check element exists first
await expect(element).toHaveCount(1);
```

---

**2. Color contrast failures**
```
Error: expect(contrastIssues.length).toBe(0)
Expected: 0
Received: 3
```

**Causes:**
- Text color too light on light background
- Insufficient contrast for accessibility

**Fixes:**
- Review Tailwind color classes
- Use darker text colors: `text-gray-900` instead of `text-gray-400`
- Check design system colors meet WCAG AA

---

**3. Performance test failures**
```
Error: expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(3000)
Expected: < 3000
Received: 4523
```

**Causes:**
- Large bundle size
- Slow API responses
- Unoptimized images
- Missing code splitting

**Fixes:**
```bash
# Analyze bundle
npm run build
# Check .next/analyze output

# Optimize images
# Use Next.js Image component

# Add dynamic imports
# Use React.lazy() for heavy components
```

---

**4. Touch target size failures**
```
Error: expect(box.height).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(44)
Expected: >= 44
Received: 32
```

**Causes:**
- Button or link too small for mobile
- Padding insufficient

**Fixes:**
```tsx
// Add minimum touch target size
className="min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px] flex items-center justify-center"
```

---

## Critical Test Cases for Children's Platform

### Why Each Test Matters

This is not just another web application. 1001 Stories serves children in underserved communities worldwide. Every bug, every slow page, every accessibility issue directly impacts a child's ability to learn and grow.

---

### 1. Accessibility Tests (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance)

**Why it matters:**
- Many children use assistive technologies (screen readers, keyboard-only navigation)
- Visual impairments are common in areas with limited healthcare
- Touch targets must work for small hands and limited motor control
- Color blindness affects 1 in 12 boys globally

**Critical test cases:**

#### Keyboard Navigation
```bash
npx playwright test volunteer-dashboard-redesign -g "Keyboard navigation"
```

**What we test:**
- Can navigate entire interface with Tab key only
- Focus indicators are clearly visible (3px blue ring minimum)
- Enter/Space keys activate buttons
- Escape key closes modals/dropdowns
- No keyboard traps (can always Tab away)

**Impact if broken:**
- Children without mouse cannot use platform
- Screen reader users get stuck
- Learning becomes impossible for some students

---

#### Screen Reader Support
```bash
# Manual test with macOS VoiceOver
Cmd + F5 to enable VoiceOver

# Navigate volunteer dashboard
# Verify all content is announced correctly
```

**What we test:**
- All images have alt text
- All buttons have accessible names
- Form fields have associated labels
- Error messages are announced
- Status changes are communicated

**Impact if broken:**
- Blind children cannot access content
- Stories become unreachable
- Platform unusable for thousands of users

---

#### Color Contrast
```bash
npx playwright test volunteer-dashboard-redesign -g "Color contrast"
```

**What we test:**
- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (normal text)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Docker Issues

#### Issue: Docker daemon not starting

**Symptoms:**
```
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Start Docker Desktop**
```bash
# macOS
open -a Docker

# Wait for Docker icon to appear in menu bar
# Wait until menu shows "Docker Desktop is running"
```

**2. Verify Docker is running**
```bash
docker --version
docker ps

# Should show version and running containers
# Not: "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"
```

**3. Restart Docker Desktop**
```bash
# If stuck, force quit and restart
killall Docker
open -a Docker
```

**4. Check Docker resource allocation**
```
Docker Desktop → Preferences → Resources
- CPUs: 4 minimum
- Memory: 4GB minimum
- Disk space: 20GB available
```

**5. Reset Docker if nothing works**
```
Docker Desktop → Troubleshoot → Reset to factory defaults
⚠️ Warning: This deletes all containers and images
```

---

#### Issue: Port 8001 already in use

**Symptoms:**
```
Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:8001: bind: address already in use
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Find what's using the port**
```bash
lsof -i :8001
# Output shows:
# COMMAND   PID   USER
# node    12345  yourname
```

**2. Kill the process**
```bash
kill -9 12345
# Or more safely:
kill 12345
```

**3. Try again**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

**4. Use different port (alternative)**
```bash
# Edit docker-compose.local.yml
# Change:
ports:
  - "8001:3000"
# To:
ports:
  - "8002:3000"

# Then use http://localhost:8002
```

---

#### Issue: Database connection errors

**Symptoms:**
```
PrismaClientInitializationError: Can't reach database server at `postgres:5432`
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Check PostgreSQL container is running**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ps

# Should show postgres container as "Up"
```

**2. Restart database container**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml restart postgres
```

**3. Check database logs**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs postgres

# Look for errors like:
# - "database system is ready to accept connections" (good)
# - "FATAL: database does not exist" (need to create)
```

**4. Reset database**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down -v
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d

# Wait 30 seconds for database to initialize
```

**5. Run migrations**
```bash
docker exec 1001-stories-app-local npx prisma migrate deploy
docker exec 1001-stories-app-local npx prisma db push
```

---

#### Issue: Container build fails

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR [stage-0 5/8] RUN npm install
npm ERR! code ENOENT
```

**Solutions:**

docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml build --no-cache
```

**2. Clear local artifacts**
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
npm install
```

**3. Check Dockerfile syntax**
```bash
# Verify no errors in Dockerfile
cat Dockerfile
```

**4. Build with verbose output**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml build --progress=plain
# Shows detailed build output
```

---

### Build and Lint Issues

#### Issue: npm run build fails

**Symptoms:**
```
Type error: Property 'stats' does not exist on type 'VolunteerDashboardProps'
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Fix TypeScript errors**
```bash
npm run type-check
# Shows all type errors

# Fix each error in the listed files
```

**2. Clear Next.js cache**
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

**3. Update dependencies**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

**4. Check for missing imports**
```bash
# Common issue: component imported but not exported
grep -r "export.*VolunteerLNB" components/
```

---

#### Issue: Linting errors

**Symptoms:**
```
✖ 15 problems (3 errors, 12 warnings)
  3 errors and 0 warnings potentially fixable with the `--fix` option.
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Auto-fix simple issues**
```bash
npm run lint -- --fix
```

**2. Review remaining errors**
```bash
npm run lint
# Read each error carefully
```

**3. Common fixes:**

**Unused imports:**
```typescript
// Before
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// After (if useEffect not used)
import { useState } from 'react';
```

**Missing dependencies in useEffect:**
```typescript
// Before
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(userId);
}, []); // ❌ userId missing

// After
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(userId);
}, [userId]); // ✅ userId included
```

**Unescaped quotes in JSX:**
```typescript
// Before
<div>Don't use unescaped quotes</div> // ❌

// After
<div>Don&apos;t use unescaped quotes</div> // ✅
```

---

### Test Failures

#### Issue: Playwright tests timing out

**Symptoms:**
```
Timeout of 30000ms exceeded while waiting for locator('[data-testid="volunteer-lnb"]')
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Increase timeout**
```typescript
// In test file
await expect(element).toBeVisible({ timeout: 60000 }); // 60 seconds
```

**2. Wait for page to be ready**
```typescript
await page.goto(url);
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
await page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded');
```

**3. Check element actually exists**
```bash
# Run in headed mode to see what's happening
npx playwright test volunteer-dashboard-redesign --headed --debug
```

**4. Verify test-id attribute exists**
```bash
grep -r "data-testid=\"volunteer-lnb\"" components/
# Should find the attribute in component file
```

---

#### Issue: Screenshot comparison failures

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Screenshot comparison failed: 43 pixels differ
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Update baseline screenshots**
```bash
npx playwright test --update-snapshots
```

**2. Review diff**
```bash
npx playwright show-report
# Click on failed test
# View visual diff image
```

**3. Adjust threshold**
```typescript
// In test file
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot({ maxDiffPixels: 100 });
```

**4. Disable screenshot tests during development**
```typescript
// Temporarily skip
test.skip('Visual regression test', async ({ page }) => {
  // ...
});
```

---

#### Issue: Cross-browser test failures (WebKit only)

**Symptoms:**
```
[webkit] › volunteer-dashboard-redesign.spec.ts:36:5 › GlobalNavigationBar displays correctly
Error: Element is not visible
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Add WebKit-specific wait**
```typescript
if (browserName === 'webkit') {
  await page.waitForTimeout(1000);
}
await expect(element).toBeVisible();
```

**2. Check for Safari-specific CSS issues**
```bash
# Look for flex bugs, grid issues
# Safari has different flex defaults
```

**3. Use feature detection**
```typescript
const isWebKit = await page.evaluate(() => {
  return /WebKit/.test(navigator.userAgent);
});
```

**4. Skip WebKit temporarily (not recommended for production)**
```typescript
test.skip(browserName === 'webkit', 'Known WebKit issue #123');
```

---

### Authentication Issues

#### Issue: Magic link not received

**Symptoms:**
- User clicks "Send Magic Link"
- Email never arrives
- No error message shown

**Solutions:**

**1. Check email service configuration**
```bash
# Check .env.local
cat .env.local | grep EMAIL

# Should have:
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@1001stories.org
```

**2. Verify SMTP credentials**
```bash
# Test SMTP connection
curl -v --url 'smtp://smtp.gmail.com:587' \
  --mail-from 'your-email@gmail.com' \
  --user 'your-email@gmail.com:your-app-password'

# Should connect without errors
```

**3. Check spam folder**
- Magic link emails often filtered as spam
- Add sender to safe list

**4. Use password authentication instead**
```bash
# Navigate to /login
# Click "Password" tab instead of "Magic Link"
# Use test account credentials
```

#### Issue: Session expires immediately

**Symptoms:**
- User logs in successfully
- Immediately redirected back to login
- Session cookie not persisting

**Solutions:**

**1. Check NEXTAUTH_URL**
```bash
# In .env.local
echo $NEXTAUTH_URL
# Should be: http://localhost:3000 (dev) or http://localhost:8001 (Docker)
```

**2. Clear browser cookies**
```
Chrome: Cmd+Shift+Delete → Cookies → Clear
```

**3. Check cookie settings in browser**
```
Chrome → Settings → Privacy → Cookies
- "Allow all cookies" should be enabled (for testing)
```

**4. Verify NextAuth configuration**
```typescript
// lib/auth.ts
export const authOptions = {
  session: {
    strategy: 'jwt',
    maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
  },
  // ...
}
```

### Performance Issues

#### Issue: Slow page load times

**Symptoms:**
- Page takes > 5 seconds to load
- Lighthouse performance score < 50
- Users report slow experience

**Solutions:**

**1. Analyze bundle size**
```bash
npm run build
# Check output for large chunks

# Look for:
# First Load JS shared by all: XXX kB
# Individual page sizes
```

**2. Implement code splitting**
```typescript
// Before
import HeavyComponent from './HeavyComponent';

// After
const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <div>Loading...</div>
});
```

**3. Optimize images**
```typescript
// Use Next.js Image component
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/image.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  loading="lazy"
  quality={75}
/>
```

**4. Enable compression**
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  compress: true, // Enable gzip compression
}
```

**5. Monitor performance**
```bash
# Run Lighthouse
# Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse → Generate report

# Check:
# - Largest Contentful Paint
# - Total Blocking Time
# - Cumulative Layout Shift
```

#### Issue: Memory leaks during navigation

**Symptoms:**
- Browser slows down after using app for a while
- Memory usage continuously increases
- Eventually browser crashes

**Solutions:**

**1. Add cleanup in useEffect**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = eventSource.subscribe(handleEvent);

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // ✅ Cleanup
  };
}, []);
```

**2. Remove event listeners**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize); // ✅ Cleanup
  };
}, []);
```

**3. Cancel ongoing requests**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const abortController = new AbortController();

  fetch('/api/data', { signal: abortController.signal });

  return () => {
    abortController.abort(); // ✅ Cancel request
  };
}, []);
```

**4. Monitor with Chrome DevTools**
```
Chrome DevTools → Memory → Take heap snapshot
Navigate around app
Take another snapshot
Compare to see what's not being cleaned up
```

### Accessibility Issues

#### Issue: Keyboard navigation not working

**Symptoms:**
- Tab key doesn't focus elements in correct order
- Some elements can't be focused
- Focus indicator not visible

**Solutions:**

**1. Add tabIndex where needed**
```typescript
// Interactive elements should be focusable
<div
  role="button"
  tabIndex={0}
  onClick={handleClick}
  onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleClick()}
>
  Click me
</div>
```

**2. Add focus styles**
```typescript
// Tailwind classes
className="focus:ring-4 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:outline-none"
```

**3. Fix focus order**
```html
<!-- Ensure DOM order matches visual order -->
<!-- Don't use CSS to reorder elements if it breaks tab order -->
```

**4. Test with keyboard only**
```
1. Unplug mouse (or don't use it)
2. Navigate entire interface with Tab
3. Ensure all features accessible
```

---

#### Issue: Screen reader announces incorrectly

**Symptoms:**
- VoiceOver reads wrong information
- Important content skipped
- Confusing announcements

**Solutions:**

**1. Add ARIA labels**
```typescript
<button aria-label="Close notification">
  <XIcon /> {/* Visual only */}
</button>
```

**2. Use semantic HTML**
```typescript
// Bad
<div onClick={handleClick}>Submit</div>

// Good
<button onClick={handleClick}>Submit</button>
```

**3. Add alt text to images**
```typescript
<Image
  src="/logo.png"
  alt="1001 Stories logo - A gradient circle with book icon"
/>
```

**4. Announce dynamic changes**
```typescript
<div role="status" aria-live="polite">
  {successMessage}
</div>
```

**5. Test with actual screen reader**
```bash
# macOS
Cmd + F5  # Enable VoiceOver
Cmd + F5  # Disable VoiceOver

# Navigate with:
# VO + Right Arrow (next item)
# VO + Left Arrow (previous item)
```

### Mobile Issues

#### Issue: Horizontal scrolling on mobile

**Symptoms:**
- Mobile page wider than screen
- Can scroll left/right
- Content cut off

**Solutions:**

**1. Find the culprit element**
```javascript
// Run in browser console
document.querySelectorAll('*').forEach(el => {
  if (el.scrollWidth > document.documentElement.clientWidth) {
    console.log('Wide element:', el);
  }
});
```

**2. Add viewport meta tag**
```html
<!-- In app/layout.tsx -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

**3. Constrain wide elements**
```typescript
// Add to offending element
className="max-w-full overflow-hidden"
```

**4. Check for fixed widths**
```bash
# Find hardcoded widths
grep -r "width: [0-9]" components/
grep -r "w-\[" components/

# Replace with responsive classes
# w-[600px] → w-full sm:w-[600px]
```

---

#### Issue: Touch targets too small

**Symptoms:**
- Hard to tap buttons on mobile
- Accidental taps on wrong elements
- Frustrating user experience

**Solutions:**

**1. Add minimum dimensions**
```typescript
// Ensure 44x44px minimum
className="min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px] p-2"
```

**2. Add spacing between elements**
```typescript
className="space-y-4" // Vertical spacing
className="space-x-4" // Horizontal spacing
```

**3. Test on real device**
```
1. Build and deploy to accessible URL
2. Open on actual phone
3. Try tapping all interactive elements
4. Adjust as needed
```

## Final Notes

### This is Not a Checkbox Exercise

These tests exist because **children's education depends on this platform working correctly.**

Every test that passes means:
- ✅ A child in Kenya can access stories
- ✅ A visually impaired student can use screen reader
- ✅ A family with slow internet can still learn
- ✅ A volunteer's contribution reaches children
- ✅ A teacher can assign books confidently

Every test that fails means:
- ❌ Some children are excluded
- ❌ Learning opportunities lost
- ❌ Platform trust diminished
- ❌ Mission impact reduced

### Test Continuously

Testing is not a one-time event before deployment. It's an ongoing practice:

**Daily:**
- Run `npm run lint` before commits
- Test your changes in browser
- Check console for errors

**Weekly:**
- Run full Playwright test suite
- Check Lighthouse scores
- Review accessibility

**Before every deployment:**
- Complete test completion checklist
- Get all sign-offs
- Document any known issues

**After every deployment:**
- Run smoke tests on production
- Monitor error logs
- Check analytics for issues

### Report Issues Immediately

If you find a bug or test failure:

**1. Document it**
```
Title: [Component] Brief description

Steps to reproduce:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Expected vs actual result

Environment:
- Browser: Chrome 120
- Device: iPhone 14
- OS: iOS 17

Screenshots:
[Attach screenshots]

Test output:
[Paste error message]
```

**2. Assess severity**
- **P0 Critical:** Breaks core functionality, blocks all users
- **P1 High:** Affects many users, workaround exists
- **P2 Medium:** Affects some users, minor impact
- **P3 Low:** Edge case, cosmetic issue

**3. Create GitHub issue**
- Use bug template
- Tag appropriately (bug, accessibility, performance, etc.)
- Assign to appropriate team member

**4. Add to testing checklist**
- Document the failure
- Add regression test
- Update test documentation

### Keep Documentation Updated

As the platform evolves:
- Update test checklists with new components
- Add new test scenarios
- Document new edge cases
- Update screenshots
- Revise success criteria

**These documents are living:**
- TESTING-SUMMARY.md (this file)
- VOLUNTEER_DASHBOARD_TEST_PLAN.md
- VOLUNTEER-VISUAL-TEST-CHECKLIST.md
- MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md
- PUBLISHING_WORKFLOW_TEST_GUIDE.md

**Update them when:**
- New features added
- Components redesigned
- User feedback received
- Bugs discovered and fixed
- Testing process improved
