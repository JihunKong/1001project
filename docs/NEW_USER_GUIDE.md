## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why don't I choose a role during signup anymore?**
A: We simplified the process to reduce friction and help you discover features naturally. Most users don't need specialized roles immediately, and this approach gets you started faster.

**Q: What if I was previously a Teacher or Institution user?**
A: Your elevated permissions remain intact. The change only affects new signups. See our [Migration FAQ](./MIGRATION_FAQ.md) for details.

**Q: How do I unlock classroom features?**
A: Either request Teacher access through your account settings, or the system will automatically suggest it based on your usage patterns (creating reading lists, organizing content for groups, etc.).

**Q: Can I still volunteer or contribute content?**
A: Absolutely! Request Volunteer access through your account settings, or start by engaging with the community. Active contributors are often invited to join our volunteer program.

**Q: Is there a cost difference between Customer and elevated roles?**
A: No. Role assignments are based on functionality needs, not payment tiers. Premium content and subscriptions work the same regardless of your role.
