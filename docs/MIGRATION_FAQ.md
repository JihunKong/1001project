# Migration FAQ: Simplified Role System

## What Changed and Why

We've simplified our user onboarding system to make 1001 Stories more accessible and user-friendly. This FAQ addresses common questions about the transition from role-based signup to our new Customer-first approach.

## Overview of Changes

### What's New
âœ… **Everyone starts as "Customer"** - no role selection during signup
âœ… **Progressive feature discovery** - capabilities unlock based on usage and need
âœ… **Simplified onboarding** - faster account creation process
âœ… **Flexible growth paths** - your account evolves with your interests

### What Stayed the Same
âœ… **All existing features** remain available
âœ… **Current user accounts** keep their elevated permissions
âœ… **Content library and quality** unchanged
âœ… **Privacy and security** standards maintained

## For Existing Users

### Q: I'm already a Teacher/Institution/Volunteer user. Do I lose access?

**A: No! Your current role and all associated features remain exactly as they are.**

Your account maintains:
- All current permissions and features
- Access to role-specific dashboards
- Historical data and settings
- Existing subscriptions and purchases

The only change is that new users will start as Customers and request elevated access when needed.

### Q: Will my dashboard look different?

**A: No changes to existing user dashboards.**

If you currently have:
- **Teacher dashboard** â†’ Remains identical with all classroom features
- **Institution dashboard** â†’ No changes to school management tools  
- **Volunteer dashboard** â†’ All content creation tools still available
- **Admin dashboard** â†’ Enhanced with new role management features

### Q: What about my students/classes/content I've created?

**A: Everything remains intact.**

- **Teachers**: All classes, student rosters, and assignments preserved
- **Institutions**: School partnerships and licensing agreements unchanged
- **Volunteers**: Published content and ongoing projects continue normally
- **All users**: Reading history, bookmarks, and preferences maintained

### Q: Do I need to do anything during this transition?

**A: No action required from existing users.**

The system update happens automatically and only affects:
- New user signup process
- Admin role management tools
- Feature discovery for future users

Your account continues working exactly as before.

## For New Users

### Q: Why can't I choose my role during signup anymore?

**A: We found that most users were unsure which role to pick, leading to:**
- Abandoned signups due to analysis paralysis
- Users choosing wrong roles and getting confused
- Complex onboarding flows that overwhelmed new users
- Reduced platform adoption

The new system gets you started immediately and suggests role upgrades naturally as you use the platform.

### Q: What if I'm a teacher and need classroom features right away?

**A: You can request Teacher access immediately after creating your account.**

**Fast-track process for educators:**
1. Sign up as Customer (2 minutes)
2. Go to Account Settings â†’ Request Teacher Access
3. Provide your school email or credentials
4. Get approved within 24-48 hours (often same day for .edu emails)

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Try the platform first to ensure it meets your needs
- No commitment until you're sure it's right for your classroom
- Easier to onboard even if you're unsure about specific features needed

### Q: I'm signing up for my whole school. How does this work?

**A: Institution onboarding remains streamlined with dedicated support.**

**Recommended process:**
1. **Administrator signs up** as Customer initially
2. **Requests Institution access** with school documentation
3. **Gets expedited review** (usually within 2-3 business days)
4. **Receives bulk onboarding tools** for staff and students
5. **School-wide features** activated immediately upon approval

**Why this works better:**
- Test the platform before committing your institution
- Ensure it aligns with your school's educational goals
- Get personalized setup assistance from our team

### Q: What if I want to volunteer/contribute content?

**A: The volunteer application process is now more structured and supportive.**

**New volunteer path:**
1. **Start as Customer** to understand the platform and community
2. **Engage with existing content** (reading, reviewing, participating)  
3. **Request Volunteer access** when you're ready to contribute
4. **Complete skills assessment** or submit portfolio samples
5. **Join volunteer community** with proper onboarding and support

**Advantages for volunteers:**
- Better understanding of platform needs before contributing
- More thorough preparation and training
- Higher quality contributions from committed volunteers
- Stronger volunteer community with shared experience
