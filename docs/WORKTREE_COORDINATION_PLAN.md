## üîÑ Merge Protocol

### Sequential Merge Order (CRITICAL)
This order minimizes conflicts:

1. **code-quality ‚Üí main** (Week 1)
   - Provides clean codebase
   - No conflicts expected

2. **role-definitions ‚Üí main** (Week 1)
   - Foundation for authorization
   - May conflict with middleware.ts (resolve carefully)

3. **workflow-implementation ‚Üí main** (Week 2)
   - Business logic and APIs
   - May conflict with API routes (test thoroughly)

4. **figma-design ‚Üí main** (Week 3-4)
   - UI components
   - May conflict with existing pages (review PR carefully)

### Merge Checklist for Each Worktree
```bash
# Before merge:
[ ] All tests pass (npm run lint, npm run build)
[ ] No console errors in browser
[ ] Playwright E2E tests pass (if applicable)
[ ] PR created with detailed description
[ ] Code review completed (if team members available)

# Merge command (from main worktree):
git checkout main
git fetch origin [branch-name]
git merge origin/[branch-name] --no-ff -m "Merge [branch-name]: [description]"

# After merge:
git push origin main
[ ] Verify production deployment works
[ ] Monitor for errors in logs
```

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Potential Conflicts

1. **Middleware Changes** (role-definitions)
   - **Risk**: Middleware.ts conflicts with existing auth logic
   - **Mitigation**: Backup middleware.ts before merge, test thoroughly

2. **API Route Conflicts** (workflow-implementation)
   - **Risk**: New `/api/text-submissions` routes may conflict with existing routes
   - **Mitigation**: Review all API routes, ensure no duplicates

3. **UI Component Naming** (figma-design)
   - **Risk**: New components may conflict with existing UI components
   - **Mitigation**: Use namespacing (e.g., `StoryPublicationForm` instead of `Form`)

### Rollback Strategy
```bash
# If merge causes critical issues:
git log                          # Find merge commit hash
git revert -m 1 [merge-commit]   # Revert merge
git push origin main             # Deploy rollback

# Then fix issues in worktree and re-merge
```
