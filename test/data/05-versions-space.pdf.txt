Our storytelling program, 1001  Stories, brings meaningful 
learning  to  some  of  the  hardest  to  reach  populations  
around  the  world.  We  aim  to  facilitate  the  creation,  
development, and gathering of 1001 empowering stories 
from every participating local community. 
Children  love  to  tell  stories.  However,  in  many  places  
in  the  world,  their  creative  voices  are  rarely  heard  
or   cultivated.   The   1001   Stories   Program   conducts   
storytelling  workshops  that  build  on  children’s  natural  
potential  to  become  original  storytellers.  Through  the  
1001  Stories  Program,  children  are  empowered  while  
their literacy skills are developed. 
When integrated with technologies, these stories become 
an  effective  tool  for  literacy  by  growing  reading  and  
writing  skills  grounded  in  local  languages  and  local  
themes in underserved areas worldwide.

I 
t was a dark silent night in an African village. Suddenly, 
the only coffee farm in the village caught fire and the 
 
people didn’t know what to do. The farm was burning 
with raging flames, but a small girl was running around 
 
the dangerous fire and screaming her lungs out.
 
“Grandma! Grandma! Where are you? It’s me, Neema! 
Please answer me!”
 





 
Neema’s grandmother was born with disabled legs so 
for all her life she used both her fragile arms to
 
move around.
 
That night, Neema’s grandmother was still not home 
even though it was past midnight, so Neema 
 
went to the farm to search for her grandmother when 
she saw the huge fire. Neema ran as fast 
 
as she could to the burning farm while wishing for 
her grandma to be safe. However, her grandmother 
 
had passed away unable to avoid the spreading fire 
before Neema even arrived.



 
Neema thought of her grandmother’s words she had 
told her long ago while eating the corn she had
 
brought from a store in the village before she passed 
away.
 
Neema’s grandmother said, “Neema, even though 
your mother and father are not around, do not worry 
 
because Grandmother will be with you to protect you. 
So, study hard and become a great teacher, okay?”
 
After the only person in this whole world who called 
Neema’s name ever so sweetly passed away, Neema 
 
was all of a sudden alone.
 
Neema had to work hard to pay for her school, but it 
was not even enough money to make a proper meal.  
 
Neema tried to ask for help from her teacher because 
she wasn’t able to pay tuition for that month, but the 
 
teacher was also in a difficult situation as well.

 
The teacher said, “ Neema, I’m very sorry, but you 
can no longer go to school unless you pay the tuition. 
 
I want to help you as well, but I have sick parents and 
I need to pay for their medicine, so I’m not in a good   
 
shape, either. I’m so sorry.”
 
Early in the morning, Neema went to Mrs. Mika, the 
owner of the coffee farm where her grandmother used 
 
to work. “Good morning Mrs. Mika, there is 
something I have to tell you,” Neema said.



 
“Oh, good morning, Neema. Yes, what is the thing you 
need to tell me?” Mrs. Mika asked.
 
“Ugh... Mrs. Mika, right now I don’t have enough money 
to pay for my tuition. If you lend me some money, I will 
 
come to the farm 
every day after 
school and help you 
with the farm. 

 
On the days I don’t 
have school, I can work 
all day long. When I graduate, I’ll 
make sure to pay back everything I 
borrowed,” Neema said desperately. 
 
“I’m very sorry Neema. As you know, 
because of the pouring rain this year, the 
coffee trees were not able to produce many 
beans, and the fire caused great damage to our 
farm. I didn’t even have enough money to pay our 
workers, so I had to go down to my relatives myself 
to borrow money. Right now, the villagers are so poor that  
they don’t even have enough money to buy food. I think it 
will be better for you to go to the Tanga village and look for 
a job than stay here. By the way, you don’t even have any 
relatives here any way so going to the village will be a good 
opportunity for you,” Mrs. Mika said with pity.



 
On the way home, Neema was thinking about Mrs. Mika’s 
words.
 
“Right, The Tanga village is known for its beautiful scenery 
so there will be many tourists. If I go there, I will definitely  
 
make more money to pay my tuition for school. Then I can 
fulfill my dream of becoming a teacher. I always told 
 
Grandma that I would be a great teacher one day so when 
I become a teacher, Grandma will be very proud of me 
 
from heaven,” Neema thought to herself.
 
While holding on to this small hope she had, Neema went 
to the Tanga village cheerfully.

 
“Everyone! Right 
here! Follow me 
this way, we are  almost there,” 
Neema said while guiding the 
tourists.Neema and the tourists went in the deep 
dark cave and came out safely.
 
“Everyone, today was a bit tiring, but it was fun, right?  We 
will be going to the coffee farm at ten o’clock. So, please we 
 
will meet at the entrance of the village and please don’t
 
be late. Now, I will take you to the 
restaurant where they serve the best 
 
Tanga meals in the village,” Neema said 
cheerfully. Neema took the tourists to the
 
restaurant where they sell food. Having 
been starving the whole day walking,
 
everyone enjoyed eating 
fresh fish,corn, and 
 
octopus at the restaurant.





 
Neema had a smile on her face after finishing her work 
taking the tourists around the village.
 
“Ahh, today was a bit tiring, but at least I got paid well by 
many tourists that came out when the beautiful sun shone 
 
after the rainstorm. I’m going to go eat some fried rice 
with coconut sauce at Mr. Azi’s restaurant because I 
 
earned a lot of money today,” Neema thought happily to 
herself.
 
Neema was feeling happy today from earning more money 
than she usually earned from the tourists that came to the 
 
Tanga village. So, Neema went to eat coconut fried rice at 
Mr. Azi’s restaurant since she hadn’t eaten it in a long 
 
time.
 
At that time, someone called her.“Child, wait a minute,” a 
woman called. Neema turned around to see  who 
 
was calling her. When she turned around, it was one of the 
tourists from earlier that day.“Oh, hello. Is there any 
 
problem?” Neema asked the lady.



 
Neema was worried whether there was a problem with the 
lady, but the smiling lady answered back cheerfully.
 
“No, dear, no. Your name ... was Neema, right? Please 
correct me if I’m wrong,” the lady said.
 
“Yes, my name is Neema,” Neema answered back politely.
 
“Neema... what a pretty little name. I have a little niece 
about the same age as you going to school near this 
 
village. While seeing you work at a young age made me 
feel you were a brave young lady, at the same time 
 
I felt sorry that you are working. If it’s alright with you, I 
would like to talk with you a bit longer while eating 
 
dinner together. Besides, I honestly don’t want to eat with 
people I really don’t know,” the lady said shyly.

 
Neema felt a bit burdened, but she felt happy that 
someone was caring for her in a special way.
 
“Yes! It sounds great! If we go this way, there is a 
restaurant that sells my favorite coconut fried rice, but I’m 
 
not sure if you’ll like it,” Neema said carefully.
 
Neema and the lady went to the restaurant and talked 
about many things while eating dinner together. 
 
The lady cried when Neema told her story how she had to 
make money for her tuition after her grandmother passed 

 
away by a fire outbreak recently and how both of her 
parents had died from malaria when Neema was not even 
 
three years old. While Neema was telling her story, she 
began to get teary as well, but she immediately wiped her 
 
tears and smiled brightly.
 
“Next month, I will be buying five young goats with the 
money I’ve been saving. I will raise the goats well and sell 
 
them in the market at twice the price I bought them. Then 
I will buy ten young goats again and sell them in the 
 
market, buy twenty goats and sell them in the market, and 
when I sell hundred goats, 

I am shocked by the scene and I flee the scene. 

I avoid the brothers and do not say anything 
whenever I see the them.
 
I will have enough money to go to school without 
worrying about making more money. If I just think about 
 
going back to school, I get so excited that I don’t feel 
tired at all,” Neema said cheerfully.
 
“Neema... if you want...would you like to go back to the 
city with me?” the lady asked.
 
“I’m not very rich, but I think I can help you go back to 
school. After I got married, my husband died from 
 
a disease so from then on, I live by myself. After seeing 
you, I just thought it would be very nice if Ihad a pretty 
 
daughter like you. What do you think? Do you want to 
come to the city with me?” the lady asked again.
 
Neema thought of her grandmother after listening to the 
lady’s kind words and without a second thought, she 
 
followed the lady to the city.
