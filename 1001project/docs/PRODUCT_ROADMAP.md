## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Authentication & Authorization Architecture
```typescript
// Proposed auth flow architecture
AuthFlow {
  1. Initial: Email/OAuth selection
  2. Verification: Email magic link / OAuth callback
  3. Profile: Role selection and setup
  4. MFA: Optional 2FA setup
  5. Session: JWT with refresh token
}

// Permission model
Permission {
  resource: string;      // e.g., "story", "user", "payment"
  action: string;        // e.g., "read", "write", "delete"
  conditions?: JSON;     // e.g., {"ownerId": userId}
}
```

### Payment Architecture
```typescript
// Payment processing flow
PaymentFlow {
  1. Selection: Choose payment method
  2. Validation: Client-side validation
  3. Tokenization: Secure token creation
  4. Processing: Server-side charge
  5. Confirmation: Webhook verification
  6. Fulfillment: Digital/physical delivery
}

// Subscription state machine
SubscriptionState {
  TRIAL → ACTIVE → PAST_DUE → CANCELED
         ↓         ↓
      PAUSED → RESUMED
}
```

### Data Architecture Evolution
```sql
-- Proposed schema additions for v0.5.0
CREATE TABLE payment_methods (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  type VARCHAR(50), -- 'card', 'paypal', 'bank'
  provider VARCHAR(50), -- 'stripe', 'paypal'
  token TEXT ENCRYPTED,
  is_default BOOLEAN,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE subscription_plans (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  currency VARCHAR(3),
  interval VARCHAR(20), -- 'monthly', 'yearly'
  features JSONB,
